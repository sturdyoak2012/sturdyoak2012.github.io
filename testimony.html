To satisfy popular demand, I have here an abridged version of the testimony I gave on 12/22/2019 at my baptism.  
<br><br>
<h3>The Nature of Love</h3>
Apparently me being baptized was a pretty surprising thing for some people.  But that's okay.  Maybe it's because I'm a pretty science-oriented guy, which can sort of rub against more orthodox Christian ideas.  So I thought it would be nice if I began with example from scientific history.
<br><br>
I'd like to take you all back to the tail end of the 19th century.  During this time, physics was considered a very stagnant subject.  Newton's law of gravity had been verified countless times, classical mechanics was very well developed, and Maxwell had just finished his formulation of electromagnetism.  Many people believed that physics was essentially a closed subject, kind of like tic-tac-toe, where there was nothing left to discover.  
<br><br>
However, there was a slight discrepancy in the mathematics.  Long story short, hot objects were not radiating heat in the way that physicists thought they would.  It sounds like kind of a boring thing, but it was an important gap in the theory.  Unfortunately, theories are right until they're wrong, and now it was wrong.  A new theory was needed to explain everything, and that was quantum mechanics.  Suddenly, physics went from being a very stagnant field to an absolute explosion of new science, just because things weren't radiating heat in the right way.
<br><br>
In scientific history, moments like those are known as paradigm shifts, when discrepancies in existing theory force the consideration of entirely new frames of thinking.  
<br><br>
We as people undergo similar paradigm shifts in the process of collecting experience.  Today I'd like to talk about my paradigm shift, which came from observations of this thing that we call love.  
<br><br><br><br>
You know how when you look at a word for too long it starts to look kind of funny?  Like suddenly you're not sure if it's spelled the right way?  That's sort of how it was when I thought about love.  I grew up thinking it was a pretty normal thing, but it's really not when you start looking at it a bit more critically.  
<br><br>
Now love makes sense in a lot of ways.  If a mother didn't love her child, the child would die.  In evolutionary contexts, this kind of love is a positively selected trait.  The love between a man and a woman is what allows children to be born.  Another positively selected trait.  But other kinds of love just don't make sense at all.  
<br><br>
The apostle Paul speaks of a very selfless love that "bears all things and endures all things."  Now this kind of love is very bad for you.  If you love like that, you're going to hurt yourself.  It's painful and impractical.  It doesn't make you live longer, and it doesn't make it easier for you to have a kid.  By all biological means, this kind of love should not exist.  
<br><br>
But it does.  And we even consider it to be one of the greatest things in our lives.  That's pretty trippy.
<br><br>
One of the first times I ever paid attention to this strange, selfless love was on a backpacking trip with my friends here today Daniel and Jeffery.  I remember we were camping behind some trash cans, illegally, one night in Yosemite, and Daniel and I sat there in the dark watching the moon above El Cap.  We talked a lot about girls and stuff like that, but we also talked about our fathers, which is something I had never talked about to anybody before.  I could really tell he cared about me, even though he really had no reason to do so.  This was an incredibly strange thing to me at the time.  
<br><br>
Over the years I continued to experience glimpses of this very strange love that seemed to me as being very unnatural.  It made no sense in the context of my existing frameworks.  Now I was pretty atheist during this period and I hated the sort of archaic-ness of religion, but there was one thing I hated more than religion, and that was being wrong.  Many things happened later, for which I don't have the time to share today, but I finally accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior.  After that, love wasn't so confusing anymore.
<br><br>
You see, the love that the apostle Paul speaks of is one of the most unnatural things in our world.  That's why we find its source outside of our world.  And that was the key to <i>my</i> paradigm shift.  As Christians, we make sense of this very unnatural love by believing it comes from a very unnatural place, the Holy Spirit that is given to us through the death and resurrection of Christ.  The apostle John writes: "Let us love one another, for love is from God.  If we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us."
<br><br>
I hope today can be a celebration of this beautiful love, both through our love for one another and God's love for us.
<br><br><br><br>
<h4>Miscellaneous counterclaims:</h4>
<i>But Jacob, why can't this just be a manifestation of some biological need to form groups?  Isn't the community forming nature of this friendship-esque "love" also a positive thing for selection?</i>
<br><br>
Yes, you're right.  This kind of thing exists in our world to a much larger extent than the love I speak of here.  Please don't get me wrong.  The unnatural love I refer to here is unbelievably rare.  You are lucky to ever receive it.  
<br><br>
How do we distinguish the unnatural love from the natural love?  By motive.  I'm sure you have tried to be friends with somebody before just because you felt the need to socialize, to not be lonely.  This does not qualify.  This would fall aptly under your category of innate group-forming instincts that are certainly present among all animals.  Similarly, acts of "love" that are done for the intent of some kind of social acceptance do not qualify.  
<br><br>
Admittedly, this "unnatural love" is rare.  Not only is it rare, it is hard to discern.  In my experience, it is characterized by a deep sense of incredulity, as the recipient.  If you don't think you've ever felt that, don't be worried.  Just pay attention in the future.  Be on the lookout.  You will see it someday.

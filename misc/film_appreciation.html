  <h1>"Accessible" Films I Recommend</h1>

  My personal recommendations if you were once turned off by an old film that was extremely boring but now you want to get back into the game.  All these films are well paced but also well made and they can ease you into the style of some more serious films!  All in no particular order.
  
<h3>North by Northwest (1959)</h3>
Genre: Romance/Thriller/Mystery
<br>
From Wikipedia: North by Northwest is a tale of mistaken identity, with an innocent man pursued across the United States by agents of a mysterious organization trying to prevent him from blocking their plan to smuggle out microfilm which contains government secrets.
<br>
<br>
This is probably the most crowd-pleasing Hitchcock film, and it is pure entertainment - even by today's standards!  Every aspect of this film is perfect - the music, the chemistry, the dialogue, the plot, the romance, and the cinematography.  One of my all-time favorites. 
<br>

<br>
A great film to ease you into the dialogue-style and the cinematography of the Golden Age of Hollywood. (pre-60's American films)
<br>
<br>


<h3>Raging Bull (1980)</h3>
Genre: Drama
<br>
From Wikipedia: The film, distributed by United Artists, stars Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta, an Italian-American middleweight boxer whose self-destructive and obsessive rage, sexual jealousy, and animalistic appetite destroyed his relationship with his wife and family.
<br>
<br>
This film is as beautiful as it is gut-wrenching.  Jake LaMotta is one of the most despicable heroes in cinema, but his story is oddly sympathetic.  <i>Raging Bull</i> is the masterpiece of a great director.  The primary themes are guilt, insecurity, and what it means to be a man.  A personal favorite, and a must-watch for every man.

<br>
<br>

<h3>The 400 Blows (1959)</h3>
Genre: coming of age
<br>
From Wikipedia: Written by Truffaut and Marcel Moussy, the film is about Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood adolescent in Paris who struggles with his parents and teachers due to his rebellious behavior. 
<br>
<br>
This film is considered one of the greatest French films of all time - that might be a turn-off for some people, but it's still a very personal film.  Above all, this film is a portrayal of the directionlessness of adolescence and the difficulty of being understood.  You should watch it if you are a teenager or were once a teenager. 
<br>
<br>
Stylistically, it is kind of in the film-realism category: there is not really a plot and it's more of a character-driven film where all the interactions are very realistic.  It will take some patience, but it is not boring.

<br>
<br>

<h3>American Graffiti (1973)</h3>
Genre: comedy/coming of age
<br>
From Wikipedia: Set in Modesto, California, in 1962, the film is a study of the cruising and early rock 'n' roll cultures popular among Lucas's age group at the time. Through a series of vignettes, the film tells the story of a group of teenagers and their adventures over the course of a single night.
<br>
<br>
Some films are considered great for one reason only: the ability to capture a brief moment of time and place.  This film doesn't do much more than that, but it does it perfectly.  It's a feel good movie that makes you grin the entire time, but also deeply nostalgic.


<br>
<br>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</h3>
Genre: Drama
<br>
<br>
A beautiful film!  Not revolutionary in terms of character depth, but it is a cohesive and well made film.  Infinitely popular and probably the ideal starting point.
<br>

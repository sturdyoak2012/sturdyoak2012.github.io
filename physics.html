<h3>
  My background:
</h3>
Earlier in my life, I spent a lot of time studying for mathematics competitions.  In my sophomore year of high school, I switched to studying physics, and that's what I've been doing since.  I have participated in various physics competitions, and I plan to major in physics as an undergraduate!  
<br><br>

<h4>Advice for physics competitions:</h4>
<div style='font-size: 10px'>Sometimes people come to me asking for book recommendations, or study strategies, or problem sources.  There are a lot of ways to approach physics competitions (and also a lot of better things you could do with your time...), but here is a strategy taken by most of the successful physics people I've talked to.
<ol>
  <li>Be good at math.  <br> For some reason, the upper echelons of high school physics competitions (and computer science) are populated almost entirely by students who were (or are) very successful in math competitions as well.  Take from that what you will, but to have a solid understanding of high school level physics, you should have, at the very least, a strong foundation in algebra, trigonometry (vectors too), and calculus.  These three are non-negotiable.</li>
  <li>Study an introductory calculus-based mechanics book.  Practically everybody recommends <i>Physics</i> by Resnick, Halliday, and Krane.  Resnick, Halliday, and Walker or Young and Freedman (what I used) will function just as well, but they are written for a more basic audience.  Morin's books are too hard, come back to them later.</li>
  <li>Do a lot of problems.  Preferably, you do problems as you go through your study of mechanics.  There are two kinds of problems: back-of-the-chapter problems that just require a simple plug-and-chug to help solidfy your toolset and really-tough problems that expand your problem solving capabilities.  Aim to do a good bit of both.  Really-tough problems should just be taken straight from the f=ma.  Use <a href="physics/packet.pdf">this pdf</a> to help you.  It lists problem difficulties and categorizes them, which is very useful for your preparation.  Your goal is to be able to consistently solve 20/25 correctly on the f=ma!</li>
  <li>Study thermodynamics and electromagnetism (and waves and optics and some basic modern physics principles if you have the time).  The best book is, again, Resnick, Halliday, and Krane.  At this point, it should be your bible.  You can go through it chapter by chapter and you will do well on the USAPhO.  </li>
  <li>Do a lot of problems.  At this point, you should be looking for USAPhO-level problems.  Do all of them (avoid reading solutions if you don't know how to solve them; this wastes valuable problems, just come back to these problems later).</li>
  <li>Done with USAPhO problems? Look at IPhO, APhO (hardest ones), and Jaan Kalda's website.</li>

<h3>
	Original projects:
</h3>
Here are some problems that I've researched for fun.  You might find some of the math to be not as interesting, but I have a lot of interesting pictures and plots that you might find interesting as a casual reader.  But if you're really interested by it, don't be daunted by the math!  Most of it is at a basic calculus level.
<ul>
	<li><a href="physics/bucket.html">The bucket question (Circular caustics)</a><br>What's that shape that light forms on the bottom of any reflective cylinder?  Some various approaches to this problem, using computer and analytical methods. <br><br>
		<img src="physics/buck_img/rice.jpg" style="width:30%"></li><br><br>
  <li>
    <a href="physics/repose.html">Fun with sand (Angle of Repose)</a><br>What is the slope of the sand that collects in the bottom of the hourglass?  How does the shape of the sand grains affect the slope?  Microscopes, Fourier analysis....<br><br>
    <img src="physics/rep_img/cover.jpg" style="width:30%"><br><br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Fun questions:
</h3>
These are some intriguing questions I've written about.  Some of them are questions I've come up on my own - others are just fascinating things that I've come across in my reading.  
<ul>
    <li><a href="physics/atmospheric_refraction.html">Real sunsets (atmospheric refraction)</a><br>How much later does the sun set due to the refraction of light in the atmosphere?<br>And a generalization of the sun's positional error to times other than sunset<br><bR>
    <img src="physics/atm_img/sunset.jpg" style="width:30%"></li><br><br>
    <li>
    <a href="physics/prainbows.html">Pavement rainbows</a><br>An interesting phenomenon that you may have observed in the past.  (Not to be confused with "rainbow" color patterns formed by oil films on pavement.)<br><br>
    <img src="physics/pr_img/rainbow.png" style="width:30%"><br><br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Fun projects:</h3>
These are fun physics-related projects that I've done over the years that don't necessarily examine a particular question.
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="physics/corona.html">Corona discharge</a> [on hold]
    <br>
    Trying to photograph the faint blueish violet corona discharge of transmission towers.  (Corona discharge is the ionization of air in regions with high electric field.)
    <br><br>
    <img src="physics/cor_img/1.jpg" style="width: 30%"><br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="physics/spectrometer.html">Home Spectrometer!</a>
    <br>
    Trying to make a small budget spectrometer.  Originally tried to use darkroom photo paper as a sensor - did not work that well.
    <br><br>

  <li>
    <a href="physics/orbits.html">n-body simulation</a> 
    <br>
    Some faffing around with MATLAB, creating a n-body simulation.  Comparing various integration methods.

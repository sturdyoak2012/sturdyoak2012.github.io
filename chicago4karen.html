  <b>Prompt:</b>  Chicago author Nelson Algren said, "A write does well if in his whole life he can tell the story of one street." Chicagoans, but not just Chicagoans, have always found something instructive, and pleasing, and profound in the stories of their block, of Main Street, of Highway 61, of a farm lane, of the Celestial Highway.  Tell us the story of a street, path, road---real or imagined or metaphorical.
  <br><br><br><br>
Note from the author: This is a story about U.S. Route 395, the section that runs parallel to the crest of the Sierra Nevada for about a hundred miles of desert.  My father and I drove down this highway after a backpacking trip, on the way home.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Some will say that Yosemite is the jewel of the Sierra.  Its facets shine from glacial polish, made to be displayed, to be adored—the firstborn—built for the rows of parked cars, one after another.  Sparkling sedans owned by the rich couples, worn-out sedans owned by the working couples.  Sparkling SUVs owned by the rich families, worn-out SUVs owned by the working families.  Vacationers.  They gaze, they awe, they smile, they laugh, they vie for parking and cry for food.  The parking never appears and the food is never bought, so they cry some more and the food is still not bought.  It is a lustful jewel, a stone for the prostitute.
<br><br>
The machine regurgitates them to make room for more, a click of the tollbooth register and the action of a metal lever and they follow out, out of favor, out of sight.  The pamphlets, the brochures, the maps, the smiles and the hellos, these are left behind.  They are in the desert now.
<br><br>
This is a real road.  There are gas stations and not gift shops, truck stops and not vistas.  A homeless man.  He feels what the men inside cars do not—the hot wind of dust that stings the nose.  He remains on his corner, but the others continue on.  
<br><br>
It is a lonely road.  Beware of crosswinds.  Wilson Butte.  70 miles per hour.  Convict Lake trailhead.  Somebody says, let’s go back the way we came.  Devils Postpile.  Bloody Mountain.  Toms Place.  Cars fly by too quickly on the other side of the road to see the faces inside, not even a shadow.  So the children, and some of the men too, they look up towards the mountains.  
<br><br>
These are different mountains.  These mountains are not polished—they cut, they rip, they shine with the brilliance of the sword and not the diamond: the Sierra Nevada, untouched by road and untouched by affection.  The children notice fear in their hearts and try to look away, but there is a beauty that whispers in their ears and tugs at their eyes.  Their noses inch closer to the windows.
<br><br>
Had their cars been going slower, they might have glimpsed the lines of wagons to the east.  These are furniture laden, driven by men, plodding with the patience of the oxen and the weariness of the days.  The craggy heights throw shadows into the mens’ fear laden eyes.  The faces of the women are sunk, and the children's dry lips speak of death.  These mountains are mountains for some, walls for others.
<br><br>
But even those in the fastest driving cars can see the houses.  Endless rows of houses that have no lawns, no driveways, and no mailboxes.  The houses are fenced, but not from each other.  They are fenced from the road.  On the other side of the wire, a trail of dust rises from the heels of a young Japanese boy running circles around a flagpole.  Well out of his reach, the flag flutters ironically above his head.
<br><br>
The road works its way to the southern terminus of the high Sierra Nevada.  The peaks here are higher than those farther north—higher, craggier, and looser.  The children see it first.  The men see it shortly after.  A granite massif, flanked by a row of clean-faced spires.  On both sides, it is surrounded by peaks that appear higher, but these mountains do not carry the same strength, the same regality.  From the road, it appears small and ephemeral, visible for only a short stretch given the size of the surrounding mountains, but the men and the children know, though no one says a word, that this is the ephemerality of God.  
<br><br><br>

The rich couples, the working couples, the rich families, the working families—they all arrive here to urinate.  The mountains that towered in the western sky are reduced to rolling hills that blip the horizon.  Regular unleaded, diesel, self service.  No smoking allowed.  Press here to call attendant.  
<br><br>
The men are the first to enter the air conditioned portal.  They wander the aisles as the children urinate and the women sit inside the cars.  Doritos, Lays—extra large, extra spicy, extreme spicy, family size, party size.  Gatorade, Powerade, Monster—berry blast, two times antioxidants, thirst quenching, twelve hours energy, peak performance enhancing.  The cashier’s register dings, clangs open, and slams shut.  The cellophane bags crinkle and the receipts buzz out.  
<br><br>
But the men leave empty-handed, hands in pockets.  They leave in shame with their eyes cast downward, as if exiting a brothel.  Their gait is weary, their movement calculated.  When they finally look upwards, their eyes squint with the brightness of the desert sun, their faces holding a certain ruggedness as they walk with their mouths creased silent.  They are as virgins—virgins not to hardship, but depravity.
<br><br>
The dusty cars drive off, and a cloud of dust trails each wheel.  For a few brief moments, the dust lingers in the stagnant air and pauses, but it is swiftly gusted away by a hot desert breeze and disappears.

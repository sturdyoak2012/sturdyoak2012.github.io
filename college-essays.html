  <h4 id="commonapp">Common App Essay</h4>

My pen ran out of ink that night.  The figures of black on the pages of my notebook had been gradually fading for several pages now, and the ink had finally given up. <br><br>
I leaned back and put my feet onto the desk where the bright computer screen glowed, opened up to a pdf of a textbook.  I had been reading about various types of magnetic properties—ferromagnetism,  paramagnetism, etc.  It was dense, and I was tired.  It seemed like everybody in the house was asleep already—the hallways were dark, not even lit by the late-night light creeping through the cracks of the doors.  It had been like that a lot for the past few months.  But I couldn’t lose any precious time—the physics olympiad was only in two months now.  <br><br>
I knew that I would be prepared, but frankly, I was dreading the next two months.  The lonely nights were starting to blur together, and I began to feel that the physics I studied did not incite the same tenacious curiosity it once did.   It felt forced—contrived, even.  I knew what this was.  It was burn out.<br><br>
I stood up and walked around the house for a while.  I didn’t really know where to find another pen.  (I have a lot of different pens, but I had begun to use this one type exclusively.  I am picky sometimes.)<br><br>
I grabbed a glass of water and came back to stare at the diagrams of magnetic materials laid out on the screen.  <br><br>
The water was just about room temperature, and I did not like that at all.  I finished it off and looked down into the bottom of my mug.  Interestingly, the light reflecting from my lamp did not just illuminate the bottom of the mug—it also reflected off the glossy interior and formed strange patterns on the base.  I tilted it back and forth, and the cusped shapes on the bottom appeared to dance around in some exotic pirouette.  It was enchanting, just sitting there tilting that mug from side to side.<br><br>
Suddenly, those shapes brought me back to a moment from years and years prior, when I was on one of my first camping trips.  It was late at night, and I was filling up a large orange bucket with water to help put out the campfire.  I was completely alone, and just before I turned on the water, my headlamp swept the reflective insides of the orange bucket.  Those same, transient shapes appeared, lighting up the base of the bucket in dramatic fashion.  It pierced the darkness, and to this day, I still remember how amazed I was.  I was convinced that there had to be some mathematics behind it.  I turned on the water and the shapes disappeared as quickly as they had come, but I told myself that I’d figure out what they were, one day.<br><br>
I looked from the mug, back to the computer, and down to the scribbled notes I had been taking inside my notebook.  The shapes of the letters and numbers looked just as tired as the faded ink that they were written with.  What happened since that night?  What happened to the boy filling up water?  What happened to his young, unbridled curiosity?<br><br>
That January, I spent an entire weekend crunching algebra, and I derived the equations by Sunday afternoon.  It was tedious work, but I was fascinated.<br><br><br><br>

Later, some of my friends saw the work that I did, and I recall one of them asking, “Jacob, what’s the point of all this?  I mean it’s interesting, but…”  <br><br>
The truth is, there wasn’t really any <emph>purpose</emph>—my work didn’t win me any awards, and it certainly wasn’t published.  However, it reignited my interest at a time when my physics seemed to lack any real flavor.  Now, physics captivates me.  It’s difficult, but it feels effortless—beautifully so.

Jeffrey was only eleven years old when he joined my boy scout troop, and I was not the fondest of him.  But when all the older boy scouts seemed to dismiss him as immature, I decided to be his friend.  I spent a lot of time with him.  (Of course, I spent a lot of time with other people too.)  We camped together, we went backpacking together, and we also played an inordinate amount of cards together.  <br><br>

Now, Jeffrey is 14 years old, and he's a key part of our troop.  He leads backpacking trips and also codes the website.<br><br>

More so now than ever, I realize the enormous influence I had on young teenage kids like Jeffrey, whether these are people in my boy scout troop or my church.  Some of my most prominent traits, good and bad, can be found in the young people that I've spent the most time with.  I think these teenagers lack relevant role models in their life, and they tend to latch strongly onto people they respect.  My contribution to their lives is just being that person who is there to show them how to find out who they really are.  I like to think of it as growing people, just as a gardener grows flowers. <br><br>

There are still some things that Jeffrey needs to work on, like being more unselfish.  My goal for him is just to become a man with character who knows how to love other people.

The summer after my junior year, I moved to a new house about ten miles from the home I had lived in for more than a decade.  <br><br>

My first night in the new house was a foreign experience.  Waking up, I nearly broke my heels swinging my feet out of bed, since the bed was three feet closer to the ground now.  I blundered into closets trying to find the bathroom.  And as luck would have it, I had to open every single one of the 15 kitchen drawers before I could find the chopsticks. <br><br>

Yes, many things have changed.  But there is one thing that the new house has inherited from the old home.  It's my bookshelf.  I've read most of the books, but other books have only been opened once or twice.  There's an entire shelf of physics textbooks, a section for math problem books, several American classics, some sci-fi, a few books by Richard Feynman, and a couple English translations of the Bible.  There's also a copy of David Copperfield that I've always been too intimidated to open... <br><br>

As I examine the eclectic set of books that I've lived with my whole life, this thought sticks to me—these books shaped me.  My bookshelf not only shaped my intellectual interests, but it also inspired my lifelong aspiration for knowledge.  I love learning, and I want to do it for the rest of my life! <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>

After receiving a silver medal on the USAPhO, I was intensely motivated to do even better.  During my junior year, I studied physics almost religiously, aiming to get a gold medal the following year. <br><br>

I was seriously burned out by winter.  In hindsight, this wasn't a surprise.  At one point, I was even considering skipping the olympiad.  I lost my motivation for studying physics, but horrifyingly, I also discovered that my enthusiasm for science had quietly faded without me even noticing.  Before, I had a driving motivation, even if I didn't actually care about the physics.  Now, I had nothing.   <br><br>

I took a break for a while.  I didn't touch physics, I didn't do my school homework, and I watched a lot of TV.  But that wasn't all...  During the sunshine between stretches of rainy days, I would skip my afternoon classes, bike up to a small preserve near my home, and hike on some of the trails by myself.  There was a small grass field as well, and if the ground wasn't too wet I'd sit and watch the surrounding mountains.   <br><br>

Gradually, I got back some of that science-y spark, just from plain being curious.  On my hikes, I'd ask myself things like, why does bark have these vertical splits? or how does dried dirt form cracks? or why is it clearest after rainy days? <br><br>

I did end up getting that gold medal, but more importantly, I had a totally different perspective in my physics. <br><br>

Physics Camp:<br><br>

Since I scored within the top 20 nationally on the USA Physics Olympiad, I was invited to the training camp in Maryland.  I was surprised by the scope and rigor of the physics we covered.  It was very challenging for me, and I didn’t understand a lot of things.  <br><br>

However, I was inspired by the sheer level of mathematical rigor in the physics we learned.  I was practically lost most of the time, and it drove me to learn more.  <br><br>

Some instructors were college students, and others were professors, but all of them showed great enthusiasm for physics, even outside of their lectures and during our dinner table conversations.  It made me want to become a physicist myself.<br><br>
<br><br>
Backpacking:<br><br>

Since eleven years old, I have loved backpacking, particularly in the Sierra Nevada. 
<br><br>
Spending so much time in the outdoors has increased my own appreciation for the natural world, and this as been a significant factor in inspiring my curiosity for the natural sciences.  (It also makes me want to study geology, which, as Sheldon Cooper would say, is like blasphemy against physics.)
<br><br>
Overall, the world fascinates me, whether I’m standing inside glacially carved cirques or watching cold water circulate in my glass of water.
<br><br><br><br>
Teaching:
<br><br>
My experience tutoring math and physics has been frustrating sometimes: some students don’t work as hard as I would like them to and some students just don’t seem to receive the same enthusiasm I have for the subjects I teach.  
<br><br>
However, I found out I that I really enjoy sharing knowledge with other people.  Sometimes I feel very excited when I learn certain things, and my teaching is centered around making other people excited about the same things.  For example, some math problems have very clever and “slick” solutions.  It always makes me very pleased to see the look on my student’s face when he or she discovers it after bashing through the “stupid” way. <br><br><br><br>

<h5 id='caltech2'>Short Answer 2</h5>
 I play a lot of cards.  (I have played cards in California, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, and Minnesota; at elevations ranging from 0 to 10,600 feet; in sunshine and in rain; and once, even while hiking.)<br><br>

The thing about card games that makes them constantly interesting is how strategy and style of play evolves when the same group of people play the same game over and over again.  <br><br>

In “Kemps,” each person, in teams of two people, have four cards in their hand and need to replace their cards with the four cards in the middle to get four-of-a-kind in their hand.  When one person in the team gets four-of-a-kind, his partner needs to call “kemps!” in order to score the point and end the round.  However, the opposing team can call “stop-kemps!” when they suspect the other team to have four-of-a-kind, thus preventing the point from being scored.  Hence, codes and signals are required.  
<br><br>
When my (very smart) friends and I first started playing the game, we were novices.  Gradually, as codes were cracked and hands tracked, the strategy thickened as well. 
<br><br>
Partners began to use more advanced codes—advanced enough to be uncrackable and simple enough to be decipherable instantaneously.  Some partners combined verbal and non-verbal signalling techniques with established bluffs, some partners signalled their hands at three-of-a-kind to eliminate the need for a signal at four-of-a-kind, and some partners used a simple form of public-key cryptography to change their code at the beginning of every new round.  
<br><br>
Defensive strategy became very complex as well.  Some partners would designate a player to not bother collecting cards and track hands the entire round, some players would avoid revealing their knowledge of another team’s code and instead play under the guise of a very good tracker, and some players would use probabilistic methods combined with “tells” to simply guess when it was likely somebody had four-of-a-kind.  
<br><br>
The simple example of the card game showcases the sort of collaboration I hope to have at Caltech, whether it’s through doing problem sets or working together on projects.  At first glance, it appears that people are working against each other, in both Caltech’s competitive environment and in the card game.  However, in the case of the card game, the winning alone is not as meaningful as the development of its strategy and the discovery of its hidden nuances.

I like backpacking, particularly in the Sierra Nevada due to its proximity and fair weather.  These are some things I have learned about backpacking over the hundreds of miles that I have walked.  <br><br>

A backpacker needs to be able to set aside some socially accepted standards of hygiene in order to explore the mountains to their fullest.  The longest I have gone without a shower is eight days, which is a record I have tied four times.  The longest I have gone without a poop is four and a half days, a measly number that I am continually trying to improve upon.  <br><br>

Backpackers reap some of the greatest rewards that nature has to offer, but often at a steep price that they must be willing to pay.  I have suffered all kinds of ailments while in the backcountry, everything from sunburn and diarrhea to inner-thigh-chafing and Giardiasis (water parasite).  On certain unfortunate circumstances, the nether regions have been affected as well—the culprits including, but not limited to, hemorrhoids (back side), poison oak (front side), and fire ants (front side). <br><br>

In rugged terrain, backpackers are not always able to find the best campsites once it comes time to sleep.  I have slept in forests, in snow, on a dry lake bed, behind trash cans in a Yosemite parking lot, and, by necessity, in the middle of an unused road.  (I received flak from my crew members after informing everybody that the road was “most likely” not accessible by cars anymore.)   <br><br>

But for all backpackers, the thing that keeps them coming back to the mountains year after year is the liberation from the tight constraints of civilization.  On trips, I have peed on rocks, on snow, into bottles, in poison oak (this one should sound familiar), off cliffs, and into campfires.  But my crowning achievement was peeing onto Canada while standing on the border and chanting “I love America!”.<br><br>

I believe that, sometimes, the best way to learn science is by examining scientific history.  Isaac Newton used Kepler’s laws of planetary motion to arrive at his law of universal gravitation.  Kepler’s laws of planetary motion were determined using Tycho Brahe’s lifetime of celestial observation.  Brahe’s extremely accurate measurement techniques, without the aid of a telescope, were developed and refined through millennia of astronomical observations across nearly all ancient and medieval civilizations.  Just like that, the fundamentals of physics can be traced back to its most basic roots.  <br><br>

Often, the historical basis of these theories are just as meaningful as the theories themselves.<br><br>

When James Clerk Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, there was no apparent medium for the wave (that we now know to be light) to propagate through.  A theoretical medium was assigned to take the role of the light-propagator, and physicists called it “luminiferous aether,” or “ether.”  This ether was invisible, had no mass, and could not be detected, but it was how light made its way through space.  Later, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley disproved the existence of ether in their famous experiment, proving that light was a wave with no medium.  However, the path of this invisible substance through the annals of scientific history remains fascinating.  The Lorentz transformations derived by Hendrik Lorentz were calculations about the properties of ether.  Albert Einstein later restated these transformations to propose his special theory of relativity.  It’s ironic that a theory that has held up under a century of experimental result was based almost entirely upon an idea that was shown to be completely false.<br><br>

Now, one of the most recent developments in modern physics, the Higgs Field, has been hailed as a reincarnation of that infamous “ether theory.”  I don’t understand any of the details, but it does show that old ideas, wrong as they might be, can still have meaning.  <br><br>

I hope it’s clear now that I firmly believe in the importance of historical legacy as a means for shaping modern scientific thought.  This is why I want to be at the University of Chicago.  Some schools are just famous names that hold legendary status in culture, but the  University of Chicago holds legendary status in scientific history.  Michelson, the disprover of ether, was the first head of the University of  Chicago physics department.  His discovery paved the way for special relativity and modern-day notions about light.  Robert Millikan conducted his Nobel-winning oil drop experiment at the University of Chicago that calculated the charge and mass of the electron.  Of course, the first nuclear reactor, designed by Enrico Fermi, was built at the University of Chicago to demonstrate nuclear fission.  The effects of this demonstration for scientific history are obvious.  I want to be part of this scientific community that, like the ones that came before them, is not afraid to influence modern scientific thought in enormous ways.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h1>THE RELATION OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Some fresh observations on an old
problem</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">by RICHARD P. FEYNMAN</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">"The Relation of Science and Religion" is a
transcript of a talk given by Dr. Feynman at the Caltech YMCA Lunch Forum on
May 2, 1956.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In this age of specialization men
who thoroughly know one field are often incompetent to discuss another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The great problems of the relations
between one and another aspect of human activity have for this reason been
discussed less and less in public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When we look at the past great debates on these subjects we feel jealous
of those times, for we should have liked the excitement of such argument.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The old problems, such as the relation
of science and religion, are still with us, and I believe present as difficult
dilemmas as ever, but they are not often publicly discussed because of the
limitations of specialization.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">But I have been interested in
this problem for a long time and would like to discuss it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of my very evident lack of
knowledge and understanding of religion (a lack which will grow more apparent
as we proceed), I will organize the discussion in this way: I will suppose that
not one man but a group of men are discussing the problem, that the group
consists of specialists in many fields Ð the various sciences, the various
religions and so on Ð and that we are going to discuss the problem from various
sides, like a panel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each is to
give his point of view, which may be molded and modified by the later discussion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, I imagine that someone has
been chosen by lot to be the first to present his views, and I am he so chosen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I would start by presenting the
panel with a problem: A young man, brought up in a religious family, studies a
science, and as a result he comes to doubt Ð and perhaps later to disbelieve in
Ð his father's God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, this is
not an isolated example; it happens time and time again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although I have no statistics on this,
I believe that many scientists Ð in fact, I actually believe that more than
half of the scientists Ð really disbelieve in their father's God; that is, they
don't believe in a God in a conventional sense.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Now, since the belief in a God is
a central feature of religion, this problem that I have selected points up most
strongly the problem of the relation of science and religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why does this young man come to
disbelieve?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The first answer we might hear is
very simple: You see, he is taught by scientists, and (as I have just pointed
out) they are all atheists at heart, so the evil is spread from one to
another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But if you can entertain
this view, I think you know less of science than I know of religion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Another answer may be that a
little knowledge is dangerous; this young man has learned a little bit and
thinks he knows it all, but soon he will grow out of this sophomoric
sophistication and come to realize that the world is more complicated, and he
will begin again to understand that there must be a God.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I don't think it is necessary
that he come out of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are
many scientists Ð men who hope to call themselves mature Ð who still don't
believe in God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, as I
would like to explain later, the answer is not that the young man thinks he
knows it all Ð it is the exact opposite.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A third answer you might get is
that this young man really doesn't understand science correctly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I do not believe that science can
disprove the existence of God; I think that is impossible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And if it is impossible, is not a
belief in science and in a God Ð an ordinary God of religion Ñ a consistent
possibility?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Yes, it is consistent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite the fact that I said that more
than half of the scientists don't believe in God, many scientists <i>do</i><span style="font-style:normal"> believe in both science and God, in a perfectly
consistent way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But this
consistency, although possible, is not easy to attain, and I would like to try
to discuss two things: Why it is not easy to attain, and whether it is worth
attempting to attain it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">When I say "believe in
God," of course, it is always a puzzle Ð what is God?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What I mean is the kind of personal
God, characteristic of the western religions, to whom you pray and who has
something to do with creating the universe and guiding you in morals.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">For the student, when he learns
about science, there are two sources of difficulty in trying to weld science
and religion together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first
source of difficulty is this Ð that it is imperative in science to doubt; it is
absolutely necessary, for progress in science, to have uncertainty as a
fundamental part of your inner nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>To make progress in understanding we must remain modest and allow that
we do not know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing is certain
or proved beyond all doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
investigate for curiosity, because it is <i>unknown</i><span style="font-style:
normal">, not because you know the answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And as you develop more information in the sciences, it is
not that you are finding out the truth, but that you are finding out that this
or that is more or less likely.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">That is, if we investigate
further, we find that the statements of science are not of what is true and
what is not true, but statements of what is known to different degrees of certainty:
"It is very much more likely that so and so is true than that it is not
true;" or "such and such is almost certain but there is still a
little bit of doubt;" or Ð at the other extreme Ð "well, we really
don't know."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every one of the
concepts of science is on a scale graduated somewhere between, but at neither
end of, absolute falsity or absolute truth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is necessary, I believe, to
accept this idea, not only for science, but also for other things; it is of
great value to acknowledge ignorance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is a fact that when we make decisions in our life we don't
necessarily know that we are making them correctly; we only think that we are
doing the best we can Ð and that is what we should do.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></h3>

<h3>Attitude of uncertainty</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I think that when we know that we
actually do live in uncertainty, then we ought to admit it; it is of great
value to realize that we do not know the answers to different questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This attitude of mind Ð this attitude
of uncertainty Ð is vital to the scientist, and it is this attitude of mind
which the student must first acquire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It becomes a habit of thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Once acquired, one cannot retreat from it any more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">What happens, then, is that the
young man begins to doubt everything because he cannot have it as absolute
truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So the question changes a
little bit from "Is there a God?" to "How sure is it that there
is a God?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This very subtle
change is a great stroke and represents a parting of the ways between science
and religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I do not believe a
real scientist can ever believe in the same way again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although there are scientists who
believe in God, I do not believe that they think of God in the same way as
religious people do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If they are
consistent with their science, I think that they say something like this to
themselves: "I am almost certain there is a God.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The doubt is very small."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That is quite different from saying, "I know that there
is a God."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I do not believe
that a scientist can ever obtain that view Ð that really religious
understanding, that real knowledge that there is a God Ð that absolute
certainty which religious people have.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Of course this process of doubt
does not always start by attacking the question of the existence of God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Usually special tenets, such as the
question of an after&#8209;life, or details of the religious doctrine, such as
details of Christ's life, come under scrutiny first.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is more interesting, however, to go right into the
central problem in a frank way, and to discuss the more extreme view which doubts
the existence of God.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Once the question has been
removed from the absolute, and gets to sliding on the scale of uncertainty, it
may end up in very different positions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In many cases it comes out very close to being certain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But on the other hand, for some, the
net result of close scrutiny of the theory his father held of God may be the
claim that it is almost certainly wrong.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></h3>

<h3>Belief in God Ð and the facts of science</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">That brings us to the second
difficulty our student has in trying to weld science and religion: Why does it
often end up that the belief in God Ð at least, the God of the religious type Ð
is considered to be very unreasonable, very unlikely?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I think that the answer has to do with the scientific things
Ð the facts or partial facts Ð that the man learns.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">For instance, the size of the
universe is very impressive, with us on a tiny particle whirling around the
sun, among a hundred thousand million suns in this galaxy, itself among a
billion galaxies.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Again, there is the close
relation of biological man to the animals, and of one form of life to
another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Man is a latecomer in a
vast evolving drama; can the rest be but a scaffolding for his creation?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Yet again, there are the atoms of
which all appears to be constructed, following immutable laws.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing can escape it; the stars are
made of the same stuff, and the animals are made of the same stuff, but in such
complexity as to mysteriously appear alive Ð like man himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is a great adventure to
contemplate the universe beyond man, to think of what it means without man Ð as
it was for the great part of its long history, and as it is in the great
majority of places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When this
objective view is finally attained, and the mystery and majesty of matter are
appreciated, to then turn the objective eye back on man viewed as matter, to see
life as part of the universal mystery of greatest depth, is to sense an
experience which is rarely described.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It usually ends in laughter, delight in the futility of trying to
understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These scientific views
end in awe and mystery, lost at the edge in uncertainty, but they appear to be
so deep and so impressive that the theory that it is all arranged simply as a
stage for God to watch man's struggle for good and evil seems to be inadequate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">So let us suppose that this is
the case of our particular student, and the conviction grows so that he
believes that individual prayer, for example, is not heard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(I am not trying to disprove the
reality of God; I am trying to give you some idea of Ð some sympathy for Ð the
reasons why many come to think that prayer is meaningless.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, as a result of this doubt,
the pattern of doubting is turned next to ethical problems, because, in the
religion which he learned, moral problems were connected with the word of God,
and if the God doesn't exist, what is his word?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But rather surprisingly, I think, the moral problems
ultimately come out relatively unscathed; at first perhaps the student may
decide that a few little things were wrong, but he often reverses his opinion
later, and ends with no fundamentally different moral view.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There seems to be a kind of
independence in these ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the end, it is possible to doubt the divinity of Christ, and yet to believe
firmly that it is a good thing to do unto your neighbor as you would have him
do unto you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is possible to
have both these views at the same time; and I would say that I hope you will
find that my atheistic scientific colleagues often carry themselves well in
society.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Communism and the scientific viewpoint</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I would like to remark, in
passing, since the word "atheism" is so closely connected with
"communism," that the communist views are the antithesis of the
scientific, in the sense that in communism the answers are given to all the
questions Ð political questions as well as moral ones Ð without discussion and
without doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The scientific
viewpoint is the exact opposite of this; that is, all questions must be doubted
and discussed; we must argue everything out Ð observe things, check them, and
so change them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The democratic
government is much closer to this idea, because there is discussion and a
chance of modification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One
doesn't launch the ship in a definite direction.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is true that if you have a tyranny of ideas, so that you
know exactly what has to be true, you act very decisively, and it looks good Ð
for a while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But soon the ship is
heading in the wrong direction, and no one can modify the direction any
more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So the uncertainties of life
in a democracy are, I think, much more consistent with science.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Although science makes some
impact on many religious ideas, it does not affect the moral content.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Religion has many aspects; it answers
all kinds of questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First, for
example, it answers questions about what things are, where they come from, what
man is, what God is Ð the properties of God, and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let me call this the metaphysical
aspect of religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It also tells
us another thing Ð how to behave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Leave out of this the idea of how to behave in certain ceremonies, and
what rites to perform; I mean it tells us how to behave in life in general, in
a moral way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It gives answers to
moral questions; it gives a moral and ethical code.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Let me call this the ethical aspect of religion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Now, we know that, even with
moral values granted, human beings are very weak; they must be reminded of the
moral values in order that they may be able to follow their consciences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not simply a matter of having a
right conscience; it is also a question of maintaining strength to do what you
know is right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And it is necessary
that religion give strength and comfort and the inspiration to follow these
moral views.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the
inspirational aspect of religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It gives inspiration not only for moral conduct Ð it gives inspiration
for the arts and for all kinds of great thoughts and actions as well.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Interconnections</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">These three aspects of religion
are interconnected, and it is generally felt, in view of this close integration
of ideas, that to attack one feature of the system is to attack the whole
structure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The three aspects are
connected more or less as follows: The moral aspect, the moral code, is the
word of God Ð which involves us in a metaphysical question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then the inspiration comes because one
is working the will of God; one is for God; partly one feels that one is with
God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And this is a great
inspiration because it brings one's actions in contact with the universe at

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">So these three things are very
well interconnected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
difficulty is this: that science occasionally conflicts with the first of the
three categories Ð the metaphysical aspect of religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For instance, in the past there was an
argument about whether the earth was the center of the universe Ð whether the
earth moved around the sun or stayed still.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The result of all this was a terrible strife and difficulty,
but it was finally resolved Ð with religion retreating in this particular
case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More recently there was a
conflict over the question of whether man has animal ancestry.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The result in many of these
situations is a retreat of the religious metaphysical view, but nevertheless,
there is no collapse of the religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And further, there seems to be no appreciable or fundamental change in
the moral view.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">After all, the earth moves around
the sun Ð isn't it best to turn the other cheek?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Does it make any difference whether the earth is standing
still or moving around the sun?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
can expect conflict again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Science
is developing and new things will be found out which will he in disagreement
with the present&#8209;day metaphysical theory of certain religions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, even with all the past
retreats of religion, there is still real conflict for particular individuals
when they learn about the science and they have heard about the religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The thing has not been integrated very
well; there are real conflicts here Ð and yet morals are not affected.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">As a matter of fact, the conflict
is doubly difficult in this metaphysical region.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, the facts may be in conflict, but even if the facts
were not in conflict, the attitude is different.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The spirit of uncertainty in science is an attitude toward
the metaphysical questions that is quite different from the certainty and faith
that is demanded in religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is definitely a conflict, I believe Ð both in fact and in spirit Ð
over the metaphysical aspects of religion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In my opinion, it is not possible
for religion to find a set of metaphysical ideas which will be guaranteed not
to get into conflicts with an ever&#8209;advancing and always&#8209;changing
science which is going into an unknown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We don't know how to answer the questions; it is impossible to find an
answer which someday will not be found to be wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The difficulty arises because science and religion are both
trying to answer questions in the same realm here.</p>

<h3>Science and moral questions</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">On the other hand, I don't believe
that a real conflict with science will arise in the ethical aspect, because I
believe that moral questions are outside of the scientific realm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Let me give three or four
arguments to show why I believe this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the first place, there have been conflicts in the past between the
scientific and the religious view about the metaphysical aspect and,
nevertheless, the older moral views did not collapse, did not change.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Second, there are good men who
practice Christian ethics and who do not believe in the divinity of
Christ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They find themselves in no
inconsistency here.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Thirdly, although I believe that
from time to time scientific evidence is found which may be partially
interpreted as giving some evidence of some particular aspect of the life of
Christ, for example, or of other religious metaphysical ideas, it seems to me
that there is no scientific evidence bearing on the golden rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that that is somehow
different.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Now, let's see if I can make a
little philosophical explanation as to why it is different Ð how science cannot
affect the fundamental basis of morals.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The typical human problem, and
one whose answer religion aims to supply, is always of the following form:
Should I do this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Should we do
this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Should the government do
this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To answer this question we
can resolve it into two parts: First Ñ If I do this, what will happen? Ð and
second Ð Do I want that to happen?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What would come of it of value Ð of good?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Now a question of the form: If I
do this, what will happen? is strictly scientific.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, science can be defined as a method for,
and a body of information obtained by, trying to answer only questions which
can be put into the form: If I do this, what will happen?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The technique of it, fundamentally, is:
Try it and see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then you put
together a large amount of information from such experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All scientists will agree that a
question Ð any question, philosophical or other Ð which cannot be put into the
form that can be tested by experiment (or, in simple terms, that cannot be put
into the form: If I do this, what will happen?) is not a scientific question;
it is outside the realm of science.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I claim that whether you want
something to happen or not Ð what value there is in the result, and how you
judge the value of the result (which is the other end of the question: Should I
do this?) Ð must lie outside of science because it is not a question that you
can answer only by knowing what happens; you still have to <i>judge </i><span style="font-style:normal">what happens Ð in a moral way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, for this theoretical reason I think
that there is a complete consistency between the moral view Ð or the ethical
aspect of religion Ð and scientific information.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Turning to the third aspect of
religion Ð the inspirational aspect Ð brings me to the central question that I
would like to present to this imaginary panel.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The source of inspiration today Ð for strength and for
comfort Ð in any religion is very closely knit with the metaphysical aspect;
that is, the inspiration comes from working for God, for obeying his will,
feeling one with God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Emotional
ties to the moral code Ð based in this manner Ð begin to be severely weakened
when doubt, even a small amount of doubt, is expressed as to the existence of
God; so when the belief in God becomes uncertain, this particular method of
obtaining inspiration fails.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I don't know the answer to this
central problem Ð the problem of maintaining the real value of religion, as a
source of strength and of courage to most men, while, at the same time, not
requiring an absolute faith in the metaphysical aspects.</p>

<h3>The heritages of Western civilization</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Western civilization, it seems to
me, stands by two great heritages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One is the scientific spirit of adventure Ð the adventure into the
unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be
explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain
unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it Ð the humility
of the intellect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The other great
heritage is Christian ethics Ð the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of
all men, the value of the individual Ð the humility of the spirit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">These two heritages are
logically, thoroughly consistent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But logic is not all; one needs one's heart to follow an idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If people are going back to religion,
what are they going back to?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is
the modern church a place to give comfort to a man who doubts God&#8209;more,
one who disbelieves in God?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is the
modern church a place to give comfort and encouragement to the value of such
doubts?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So far, have we not drawn
strength and comfort to maintain the one or the other of these consistent
heritages in a way which attacks the values of the other?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is this unavoidable?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How can we draw inspiration to support
these two pillars of western civilization so that they may stand together in
full vigor, mutually unafraid?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is
this not the central problem of our time?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I put it up to the panel for discussion.</p>

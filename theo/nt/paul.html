	<h1>A Lexicographic Analysis of Similarities in the Pauline Epistles</h1>

    <img style="width: 100%" src="pap.jpg">
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_46#/media/File:P46.jpg">Papyrus 46</a>, showing 2 Cor 11:33-12:9 (cropped)</p>
    <br><br>

	<h3>Using Python 3</h3>

	I did a computer analysis of the word frequencies in the Greek New Testament to examine the following question:
	<br>
	<i>Which Pauline Epistles were actually written by Paul?</i>
	<br><br>
	By examining sometimes minute differences in the frequencies of the most common words (prepositions, conjunctions, and pronouns - the Greek equivalents of the, for, is, I, etc.) I was able to 
	uncover remarkable agreements with modern critical New Testament scholarship regarding stylistically similar and dissimilar Pauline epistles.  My analysis reaffirms the authenticity of
	books like Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, and Galatians while simultaneously confirming the possible pseudepigraphical ("forged") nature of Ephesians, Colossians, 1 Timothy, and Titus.
	<br><br>
	However, my analysis contradicts modern scholarship on the authenticity of 2 Timothy and suggests that it is far more Pauline than it is currently believed to be.  (The analysis also 
	contradicts modern scholarship on Philemon but this is most likely the fault of the analysis.)

	<h4>Disclaimers</h4>
	<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 10pt;">
	Disclaimer 1: This was mostly a personal project to practice my programming skills.  I was surprised by the results, especially since I did not need to optimize anything to attain them.  Real algorithms to analyze authorship are (probably) more complex and reliable, so this shouldn't be considered a substitute for real scholarship.  
<br><br>
Disclaimer 2: Any information about current scholarly consensus should be taken with a grain of salt.  First of all, most outside information in this paper came from Wikipedia.  At the very best, it's a bad research practice and at the very worst, the information is wrong.  Also, please note that both Wikipedia and modern critical analysis are skewed against conservative religious thought due to the general overrepresentation of progressive scholarship in universities.  Modern scholars are extremely quick to reject claims to authorship on the basis of occasionally minute details.  
<br><br>
Disclaimer 3: For the Christian, rejecting the teachings of certain books because they are pseudepigraphic is dangerous business.  Many times, they are considered pseudepigraphic largely in part due to the presence of "inconvenient" doctrines (misogyny is the biggest culprit) or simply because it seems different.  
<br><br>

	<h4>What is the Bible?</h4>
	<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 10pt;">
	If you are not familiar with the Bible, I can give a short introduction here.
	<br><br>
	The Bible is the authoratitive religious text of Christianity.  Protestants, Catholics, and Latter-day Saints all use a Bible (but slightly differing ones).  
	I'll be talking about the Protestant Bible here.  
	<br><br>
	Most Christians believe that the Bible is divinely inspired, that it was written by men in their languages but inspired by their God.  
	The Bible is split into two parts: the Old Testament and the New Testament, each of which consist of many individual books with different authors.
	<br><br>
	The Old Testament is also, approximately, the primary religious text of Judaism.  Its original language is Hebrew.  
	The Old Testament consists of the creation myth (Genesis), the Jewish law, the history of the Jewish people from Abraham through David and onward,
	various books of poetry and wisdom, and various books of prophecy.  Some of this prophecy was fulfilled before the life of Christ, some of it was fulfilled
	by the life of Christ (at least this is what Christians believe), and some of it possibly has not yet been (or will not ever be?) fulfilled.  
	<br><br>
	Christian faith relies firmly on the deity of Jesus Christ and the Old Testament is first and foremost a Jewish text, but the Old Testament is relevant because Christianity and Judaism are uniquely
	related.  
	<br><br>
	The New Testament is not shared by Judaism and Christianity.  It is written in Greek.  It begins with the "gospel", four books recounting what is essentially the same history: the ministry of Jesus Christ
	in Palestine, his death by crucifixion as ordered by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate (in office 26 - 36 CE), and his resurrection and appearances to many people following his death.  
	<br><br>
	That is followed by the Book of Acts, a historical account of the founding of the Christian church and its spread throughout the Roman Empire within the span of a few decades.  Of particular emphasis are the missionary journeys of the Apostle Paul.  
	<br><br>
	The latter half of the New Testament consists of letters from church leaders like Paul, James, Peter, and John to churches throughout the Mediterranean.  They contain instructions for Christian living, 
	clarifications and restatements of theological doctrine, and general encouragement.  The majority are written by the Apostle Paul, and these are termed the Pauline Epistles.  
	<br><br>
	The final book is a book of apocalyptic prophecy, called Revelation.

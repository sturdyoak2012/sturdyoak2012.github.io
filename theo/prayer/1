Father, <br>
Hear my voice as I whisper towards You.  Incline Your ear towards my cries, as You once so gently did.<br>
<br>
I am not so lost now as I once was, on those gray days where hope forgot me. On those dark days where Your arms encircled me, at my slightest whisper of despair.<br>
<br>
Yet now when hope is found and light streams on my life,<br>
I no longer hear the voice which I once could hear so clearly.  The sweet grace with which You spoke lies forgotten in my memory.<br>
<br>
Why will you not speak to my soul as You once did in the days of my troubled youth?  Have I forsaken You for my treacherous ambition?  Or was it all a dream?<br>
<br>
I can only pray (to whom?) that You are still by my side - that my heart has merely closed to you.  <br>
<br>
If only I could return to those years where everything but You lay foggy and uncertain.  Where Your light could still pierce through the darkness of my life.  I cannot find You anymore.<br>
<br>
If it is my success or my ambition, take them from me.  They can be my feeble offering to You.  Let me work away at my purposeless toils, and allow me to enjoy the disappearing fruits of my meaningless labor.  Take away the treasure that I work towards, so that You can once again be the mountain that I climb.  Let my work, whatever it may be, be once again to the glory of Your name.  <br>
<br>
I pray these things in Your Son's name.

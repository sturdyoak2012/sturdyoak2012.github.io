<p>1.1</p><br>
<p>THE LAW OF HUMAN NATURE</p>
<br><br>


Every one has heard people quarrelling. Sometimes it sounds funny and
sometimes it sounds merely unpleasant; but however it sounds, I believe
we can learn something very important from listening to the kind of
things they say. They say things like this: “How’d you like it if anyone
did the same to you?”—“That’s my seat, I was there first”—“Leave him
alone, he isn’t doing you any harm”—“Why should you shove in first?”
“Give me a bit of your orange, I gave you a bit of mine”—“Come on, you
promised.” People say things like that every day, educated people as
well as uneducated, and children as well as grown-ups.
<br><br>
Now what interests me about all these remarks is that the man who makes
them is not merely saying that the other man’s behaviour does not happen
to please him. He is appealing to some kind of standard of behaviour
which he expects the other man to know about. And the other man very
seldom replies: “To hell with your standard.” Nearly always he tries to
make out that what he has been doing does not really go against the
standard, or that if it does there is some special excuse. He pretends
there is some special reason in this particular case why the person who
took the seat first should not keep it, or that things were quite
different when he was given the bit of orange, or that something has
turned up which lets him off keeping his promise. It looks, in fact,
very much as if both parties had in mind some kind of Law or Rule of
fair play or decent behaviour or morality or whatever you like to call
it, about which they really agreed. And they have. If they had not, they
might, of course, fight like animals, but they could not quarrel in the
human sense of the word. Quarrelling means trying to show that the other
man is in the wrong. And there would be no sense in trying to do that
unless you and he had some sort of agreement as to what Right and Wrong
are; just as there would be no sense in saying that a footballer had
committed a foul unless there was some agreement about the rules of
football.
<br><br>
Now this Law or Rule about Right and Wrong used to be called the Law of
Nature. Nowadays, when we talk of the “laws of nature” we usually mean
things like gravitation, or heredity, or the laws of chemistry. But when
the older thinkers called the Law of Right and Wrong “the Law of
Nature,” they really meant the Law of Human Nature. The idea was that,
just as all bodies are governed by the law of gravitation, and organisms
by biological laws, so the creature called man also had his law—with
this great difference, that a body could not choose whether it obeyed
the law of gravitation or not, but a man could choose either to obey the
Law of Human Nature or to disobey it.
<br><br>
We may put this in another way. Each man is at every moment subjected to
several different sets of law but there is only one of these which he is
free to disobey. As a body, he is subjected to gravitation and cannot
disobey it; if you leave him unsupported in mid-air, he has no more
choice about falling than a stone has. As an organism, he is subjected
to various biological laws which he cannot disobey any more than an
animal can. That is, he cannot disobey those laws which he shares with
other things; but the law which is peculiar to his human nature, the law
he does not share with animals or vegetables or inorganic things, is the
one he can disobey if he chooses.
<br><br>
This law was called the Law of Nature because people thought that every
one knew it by nature and did not need to be taught it. They did not
mean, of course, that you might not find an odd individual here and
there who did not know it, just as you find a few people who are
colour-blind or have no ear for a tune. But taking the race as a whole,
they thought that the human idea of decent behaviour was obvious to
every one. And I believe they were right. If they were not, then all the
things we said about the war were nonsense. What was the sense in saying
the enemy were in the wrong unless Right is a real thing which the Nazis
at bottom knew as well as we did and ought to have practised? If they
had had no notion of what we mean by right, then, though we might still
have had to fight them, we could no more have blamed them for that than
for the colour of their hair.
<br><br>
I know that some people say the idea of a Law of Nature or decent
behaviour known to all men is unsound, because different civilisations
and different ages have had quite different moralities.
<br><br>
But this is not true. There have been differences between their
moralities, but these have never amounted to anything like a total
difference. If anyone will take the trouble to compare the moral
teaching of, say, the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, Hindus, Chinese,
Greeks and Romans, what will really strike him will be how very like
they are to each other and to our own. Some of the evidence for this I
have put together in the appendix of another book called <i>The Abolition
of Man</i>; but for our present purpose I need only ask the reader to think
what a totally different morality would mean. Think of a country where
people were admired for running away in battle, or where a man felt
proud of double-crossing all the people who had been kindest to him. You
might just as well try to imagine a country where two and two made five.
Men have differed as regards what people you ought to be unselfish
to—whether it was only your own family, or your fellow countrymen, or
everyone. But they have always agreed that you ought not to put yourself
first. Selfishness has never been admired. Men have differed as to
whether you should have one wife or four. But they have always agreed
that you must not simply have any woman you liked.
<br><br>
But the most remarkable thing is this. Whenever you find a man who says
he does not believe in a real Right and Wrong, you will find the same
man going back on this a moment later. He may break his promise to you,
but if you try breaking one to him he will be complaining “It’s not
fair” before you can say Jack Robinson. A nation may say treaties do not
matter; but then, next minute, they spoil their case by saying that the
particular treaty they want to break was an unfair one. But if treaties
do not matter, and if there is no such thing as Right and Wrong—in other
words, if there is no Law of Nature—what is the difference between a
fair treaty and an unfair one? Have they not let the cat out of the bag
and shown that, whatever they say, they really know the Law of Nature
just like anyone else?
<br><br>
It seems, then, we are forced to believe in a real Right and Wrong.
People may be sometimes mistaken about them, just as people sometimes
get their sums wrong; but they are not a matter of mere taste and
opinion any more than the multiplication table. Now if we are agreed
about that, I go on to my next point, which is this. None of us are
really keeping the Law of Nature. If there are any exceptions among you,
I apologise to them. They had much better read some other book, for
nothing I am going to say concerns them. And now, turning to the
ordinary human beings who are left:
<br><br>
I hope you will not misunderstand what I am going to say. I am not
preaching, and Heaven knows I do not pretend to be better than anyone
else. I am only trying to call attention to a fact; the fact that this
year, or this month, or, more likely, this very day, we have failed to
practise ourselves the kind of behaviour we expect from other people.
There may be all sorts of excuses for us. That time you were so unfair
to the children was when you were very tired. That slightly shady
business about the money—the one you have almost forgotten—came when you
were very hard up. And what you promised to do for old So-and-so and
have never done—well, you never would have promised if you had known how
frightfully busy you were going to be. And as for your behaviour to your
wife (or husband) or sister (or brother) if I knew how irritating they
could be, I would not wonder at it—and who the dickens am I, anyway? I
am just the same. That is to say, I do not succeed in keeping the Law of
Nature very well, and the moment anyone tells me I am not keeping it,
there starts up in my mind a string of excuses as long as your arm. The
question at the moment is not whether they are good excuses. The point
is that they are one more proof of how deeply, whether we like it or
not, we believe in the Law of Nature. If we do not believe in decent
behaviour, why should we be so anxious to make excuses for not having
behaved decently? The truth is, we believe in decency so much—we feel
the Rule or Law pressing on us so—that we cannot bear to face the fact
that we are breaking it, and consequently we try to shift the
responsibility. For you notice that it is only for our bad behaviour
that we find all these explanations. It is only our bad temper that we
put down to being tired or worried or hungry; we put our good temper
down to ourselves.
<br><br>
These, then, are the two points I wanted to make. First, that human
beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to
behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that
they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature;
they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking
about ourselves and the universe we live in.

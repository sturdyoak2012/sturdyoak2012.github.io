                                <p> FAITH</p>
<br><br>

I must talk in this chapter about what the Christians call Faith.
Roughly speaking, the word Faith seems to be used by Christians in two
senses or on two levels, and I will take them in turn. In the first
sense it means simply Belief—accepting or regarding as true the
doctrines of Christianity. That is fairly simple. But what does puzzle
people—at least it used to puzzle me—is the fact that Christians regard
faith in this sense as a virtue. I used to ask how on earth it can be a
virtue—what is there moral or immoral about believing or not believing a
set of statements? Obviously, I used to say, a sane man accepts or
rejects any statement, not because he wants to or does not want to, but
because the evidence seems to him good or bad. If he were mistaken about
the goodness or badness of the evidence that would not mean he was a bad
man, but only that he was not very clever. And if he thought the
evidence bad but tried to force himself to believe in spite of it, that
would be merely stupid.
<br><br>
Well, I think I still take that view. But what I did not see then—and a
good many people do not see still—was this. I was assuming that if the
human mind once accepts a thing as true it will automatically go on
regarding it as true, until some real reason for reconsidering it turns
up. In fact, I was assuming that the human mind is completely ruled by
reason. But that is not so. For example, my reason is perfectly
convinced by good evidence that anæsthetics do not smother me and that
properly trained surgeons do not start operating until I am unconscious.
But that does not alter the fact that when they have me down on the
table and clap their horrible mask over my face, a mere childish panic
begins inside me. I start thinking I am going to choke, and I am afraid
they will start cutting me up before I am properly under. In other
words, I lose my faith in anæsthetics. It is not reason that is taking
away my faith: on the contrary, my faith is based on reason. It is my
imagination and emotions. The battle is between faith and reason on one
side and emotion and imagination on the other.
<br><br>
When you think of it you will see lots of instances of this. A man
knows, on perfectly good evidence, that a pretty girl of his
acquaintance is a liar and cannot keep a secret and ought not to be
trusted; but when he finds himself with her his mind loses its faith in
that bit of knowledge and he starts thinking, “Perhaps she’ll be
different this time,” and once more makes a fool of himself and tells
her something he ought not to have told her. His senses and emotions
have destroyed his faith in what he really knows to be true. Or take a
boy learning to swim. His reason knows perfectly well that an
unsupported human body will not necessarily sink in water: he has seen
dozens of people float and swim. But the whole question is whether he
will be able to go on believing this when the instructor takes away his
hand and leaves him unsupported in the water—or whether he will suddenly
cease to believe it and get in a fright and go down.
<br><br>
Now just the same thing happens about Christianity. I am not asking
anyone to accept Christianity if his best reasoning tells him that the
weight of the evidence is against it. That is not the point at which
Faith comes in. But supposing a man’s reason once decides that the
weight of the evidence is for it. I can tell that man what is going to
happen to him in the next few weeks. There will come a moment when there
is bad news, or he is in trouble, or is living among a lot of other
people who do not believe it, and all at once his emotions will rise up
and carry out a sort of blitz on his belief. Or else there will come a
moment when he wants a woman, or wants to tell a lie, or feels very
pleased with himself, or sees a chance of making a little money in some
way that is not perfectly fair: some moment, in fact, at which it would
be very convenient if Christianity were not true. And once again his
wishes and desires will carry out a blitz. I am not talking of moments
at which any real new reasons against Christianity turn up. Those have
to be faced and that is a different matter. I am talking about moments
when a mere mood rises up against it.
<br><br>
Now Faith, in the sense in which I am here using the word, is the art of
holding on to things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your
changing moods. For moods will change, whatever view your reason takes.
I know that by experience. Now that I am a Christian I do have moods in
which the whole thing looks very improbable: but when I was an atheist I
had moods in which Christianity looked terribly probable. This rebellion
of your moods against your real self is going to come anyway. That is
why Faith is such a necessary virtue: unless you teach your moods “where
they get off,” you can never be either a sound Christian or even a sound
atheist, but just a creature dithering to and fro, with its beliefs
really dependent on the weather and the state of its digestion.
Consequently one must train the habit of Faith.
<br><br>
The first step is to recognise the fact that your moods change. The next
is to make sure that, if you have once accepted Christianity, then some
of its main doctrines shall be deliberately held before your mind for
some time every day. That is why daily prayers and religious reading and
churchgoing are necessary parts of the Christian life. We have to be
continually reminded of what we believe. Neither this belief nor any
other will automatically remain alive in the mind. It must be fed. And
as a matter of fact, if you examined a hundred people who had lost their
faith in Christianity, I wonder how many of them would turn out to have
been reasoned out of it by honest argument? Do not most people simply
drift away?
<br><br>
Now I must turn to Faith in the second or higher sense: and this is the
most difficult thing I have tackled yet. I want to approach it by going
back to the subject of Humility. You may remember I said that the first
step towards humility was to realise that one is proud. I want to add
now that the next step is to make some serious attempt to practise the
Christian virtues. A week is not enough. Things often go swimmingly for
the first week. Try six weeks. By that time, having, as far as one can
see, fallen back completely or even fallen lower than the point one
began from, one will have discovered some truths about oneself. No man
knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good. A silly idea
is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is
an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong
it is. After all, you find out the strength of the German army by
fighting against it, not by giving in. You find out the strength of a
wind by trying to walk against it, not by lying down. A man who gives in
to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have
been like an hour later. That is why bad people, in one sense, know very
little about badness. They have lived a sheltered life by always giving
in. We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until
we try to fight it: and Christ, because He was the only man who never
yielded to temptation, is also the only man who knows to the full what
temptation means—the only complete realist. Very well, then. The main
thing we learn from a serious attempt to practise the Christian virtues
is that we fail. If there was any idea that God had set us a sort of
exam. and that we might get good marks by deserving them, that has to be
wiped out. If there was any idea of a sort of bargain—any idea that we
could perform our side of the contract and thus put God in our debt so
that it was up to Him, in mere justice, to perform His—any side—that has
to be wiped out.
<br><br>
I think every one who has some vague belief in God, until he becomes a
Christian, has the idea of an exam. or of a bargain in his mind. The
first result of real Christianity is to blow that idea into bits. When
they find it blown into bits, some people think this means that
Christianity is a failure and give up. They seem to imagine that God is
very simple-minded. In fact, of course, He knows all about this. One of
the very things Christianity was designed to do was to blow this idea to
bits. God has been waiting for the moment at which you discover that
there is no question of earning a pass mark in this exam. or putting Him
in your debt.
<br><br>
Then comes another discovery. Every faculty you have, your power of
thinking or of moving your limbs from moment to moment, is given you by
God. If you devoted every moment of your whole life exclusively to His
service you could not give Him anything that was not in a sense His own
already. So that when we talk of a man doing anything for God or giving
anything to God, I will tell you what it is really like. It is like a
small child going to its father and saying, “Daddy, give me sixpence to
buy you a birthday present.” Of course, the father does, and he is
pleased with the child’s present. It is all very nice and proper, but
only an idiot would think that the father is sixpence to the good on the
transaction. When a man has made these two discoveries God can really
get to work. It is after this that real life begins. The man is awake
now. We can now go on to talk of Faith in the second sense.

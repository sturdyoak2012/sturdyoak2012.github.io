<br><br>
Very well then, atheism is too simple. And I will tell you another view
that is also too simple. It is the view I call Christianity-and-water,
the view which simply says there is a good God in Heaven and everything
is all right—leaving out all the difficult and terrible doctrines about
sin and hell and the devil, and the redemption. Both these are boys’
philosophies.
<br><br>
It is no good asking for a simple religion. After all, real things are
not simple. They look simple, but they are not. The table I am sitting
at looks simple: but ask a scientist to tell you what it is really made
of—all about the atoms and how the light waves rebound from them and hit
my eye and what they do to the optic nerve and what it does to my
brain—and, of course, you find that what we call “seeing a table” lands
you in mysteries and complications which you can hardly get to the end
of. A child saying a child’s prayer looks simple. And if you are content
to stop there, well and good. But if you are not—and the modern world
usually is not—if you want to go on and ask what is really
happening—then you must be prepared for something difficult. If we ask
for something more than simplicity, it is silly then to complain that
the something more is not simple.
<br><br>
Very often, however, this silly procedure is adopted by people who are
not silly, but who, consciously or unconsciously, want to destroy
Christianity. Such people put up a version of Christianity suitable for
a child of six and make that the object of their attack. When you try to
explain the Christian doctrine as it is really held by an instructed
adult, they then complain that you are making their heads turn round and
that it is all too complicated and that if there really were a God they
are sure He would have made “religion” simple, because simplicity is so
beautiful, etc. You must be on your guard against these people for they
will change their ground every minute and only waste your time. Notice,
too, their idea of God “making religion simple”: as if “religion” were
something God invented, and not His statement to us of certain quite
unalterable facts about His own nature.
<br><br>
Besides being complicated, reality, in my experience, is usually odd. It
is not neat, not obvious, not what you expect. For instance, when you
have grasped that the earth and the other planets all go round the sun,
you would naturally expect that all the planets were made to match—all
at equal distances from each other, say, or distances that regularly
increased, or all the same size, or else getting bigger or smaller as
you go further from the sun. In fact, you find no rhyme or reason (that
we can see) about either the sizes or the distances; and some of them
have one moon, one has four, one has two, some have none, and one has a
ring.
<br><br>
Reality, in fact, is usually something you could not have guessed. That
is one of the reasons I believe Christianity. It is a religion you could
not have guessed. If it offered us just the kind of universe we had
always expected, I should feel we were making it up. But, in fact, it is
not the sort of thing anyone would have made up. It has just that queer
twist about it that real things have. So let us leave behind all these
boys’ philosophies—these over-simple answers. The problem is not simple
and the answer is not going to be simple either.
<br><br>
What is the problem? A universe that contains much that is obviously bad
and apparently meaningless, but containing creatures like ourselves who
know that it is bad and meaningless. There are only two views that face
all the facts. One is the Christian view that this is a good world that
has gone wrong, but still retains the memory of what it ought to have
been. The other is the view called Dualism. Dualism means the belief
that there are two equal and independent powers at the back of
everything, one of them good and the other bad, and that this universe
is the battlefield in which they fight out an endless war. I personally
think that next to Christianity Dualism is the manliest and most
sensible creed on the market. But it has a catch in it.
<br><br>
The two powers, or spirits, or gods—the good one and the bad one—are
supposed to be quite independent. They both existed from all eternity.
Neither of them made the other, neither of them has any more right than
the other to call itself God. Each presumably thinks it is good and
thinks the other bad. One of them likes hatred and cruelty, the other
likes love and mercy, and each backs its own view. Now what do we mean
when we call one of them the Good Power and the other the Bad Power?
Either we are merely saying that we happen to prefer the one to the
other—like preferring beer to cider—or else we are saying that, whatever
the two powers think about it, and whichever we humans, at the moment,
happen to like, one of them is actually wrong, actually mistaken, in
regarding itself as good. Now if we mean merely that we happen to prefer
the first, then we must give up talking about good and evil at all. For
good means what you ought to prefer quite regardless of what you happen
to like at any given moment. If “being good” meant simply joining the
side you happened to fancy, for no real reason, then good would not
deserve to be called good. So we must mean that one of the two powers is
actually wrong and the other actually right.
<br><br>
But the moment you say that, you are putting into the universe a third
thing in addition to the two Powers: some law or standard or rule of
good which one of the powers conforms to and the other fails to conform
to. But since the two powers are judged by this standard, then this
standard, or the Being who made this standard, is farther back and
higher up than either of them, and He will be the real God. In fact,
what we meant by calling them good and bad turns out to be that one of
them is in a right relation to the real ultimate God and the other in a
wrong relation to Him.
<br><br>
The same point can be made in a different way. If Dualism is true, then
the bad Power must be a being who likes badness for its own sake. But in
reality we have no experience of anyone liking badness just because it
is bad. The nearest we can get to it is in cruelty. But in real life
people are cruel for one of two reasons—either because they are sadists,
that, is because they have a sexual perversion which makes cruelty a
cause of sensual pleasure to them, or else for the sake of something
they are going to get out of it—money, or power, or safety. But
pleasure, money, power, and safety are all, as far as they go, good
things. The badness consists in pursuing them by the wrong method, or in
the wrong way, or too much. I do not mean, of course, that the people
who do this are not desperately wicked. I do mean that wickedness, when
you examine it, turns out to be the pursuit of some good in the wrong
way. You can be good for the mere sake of goodness: you cannot be bad
for the mere sake of badness. You can do a kind action when you are not
feeling kind and when it gives you no pleasure, simply because kindness
is right; but no one ever did a cruel action simply because cruelty is
wrong—only because cruelty was pleasant or useful to him. In other words
badness cannot succeed even in being bad in the same way in which
goodness is good. Goodness is, so to speak, itself: badness is only
spoiled goodness. And there must be something good first before it can
be spoiled. We called sadism a sexual perversion; but you must first
have the idea of a normal sexuality before you can talk of its being
perverted; and you can see which is the perversion, because you can
explain the perverted from the normal, and cannot explain the normal
from the perverted. It follows that this Bad Power, who is supposed to
be on an equal footing with the Good Power, and to love badness in the
same way as the Good Power loves goodness, is a mere bogy. In order to
be bad he must have good things to want and then to pursue in the wrong
way: he must have impulses which were originally good in order to be
able to pervert them. But if he is bad he cannot supply himself either
with good things to desire or with good impulses to pervert. He must be
getting both from the Good Power. And if so, then he is not independent.
He is part of the Good Power’s world: he was made either by the Good
Power or by some power above them both.
<br><br>
Put it more simply still. To be bad, he must exist and have intelligence
and will. But existence, intelligence and will are in themselves good.
Therefore he must be getting them from the Good Power: even to be bad he
must borrow or steal from his opponent. And do you now begin to see why
Christianity has always said that the devil is a fallen angel? That is
not a mere story for the children. It is a real recognition of the fact
that evil is a parasite, not an original thing. The powers which enable
evil to carry on are powers given it by goodness. All the things which
enable a bad man to be effectively bad are in themselves good
things—resolution, cleverness, good looks, existence itself. That is why
Dualism, in a strict sense, will not work.
<br><br>
But I freely admit that real Christianity (as distinct from
Christianity-and-water) goes much nearer to Dualism than people think.
One of the things that surprised me when I first read the New Testament
seriously was that it talked so much about a Dark Power in the
universe—a mighty evil spirit who was held to be the Power behind death
and disease, and sin. The difference is that Christianity thinks this
Dark Power was created by God, and was good when he was created, and
went wrong. Christianity agrees with Dualism that this universe is at
war. But it does not think this is a war between independent powers. It
thinks it is a civil war, a rebellion, and that we are living in a part
of the universe occupied by the rebel.
<br><br>
Enemy-occupied territory—that is what this world is. Christianity is the
story of how the rightful king has landed, you might say landed in
disguise, and is calling us all to take part in a great campaign of
sabotage. When you go to church you are really listening-in to the
secret wireless from our friends: that is why the enemy is so anxious to
prevent us from going. He does it by playing on our conceit and laziness
and intellectual snobbery. I know someone will ask me, “Do you really
mean, at this time of day, to re-introduce our old friend the
devil—hoofs and horns and all?” Well, what the time of day has to do
with it I do not know. And I am not particular about the hoofs and
horns. But in other respects my answer is “Yes, I do.” I do not claim to
know anything about his personal appearance. If anybody really wants to
know him better I would say to that person, “Don’t worry. If you really
want to, you will. Whether you’ll like it when you do is another
question.”

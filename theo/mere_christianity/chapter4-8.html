                    <p> IS CHRISTIANITY HARD OR EASY?</p>
<br><br>

In the previous chapter we were considering the Christian idea of
“putting on Christ,” or first “dressing up” as a son of God in order
that you may finally become a real son. What I want to make clear is
that this is not one among many jobs a Christian has to do; and it is
not a sort of special exercise for the top class. It is the whole of
Christianity. Christianity offers nothing else at all. And I should like
to point out how it differs from ordinary ideas of “morality” and “being
good.”
<br><br>
The ordinary idea which we all have before we become Christians is this.
We take as starting point our ordinary self with its various desires and
interests. We then admit that something else—call it “morality” or
“decent behaviour,” or “the good of society”—has claims on this self:
claims which interfere with its own desires. What we mean by “being
good” is giving in to those claims. Some of the things the ordinary self
wanted to do turn out to be what we call “wrong”: well, we must give
them up. Other things, which the self did not want to do, turn out to be
what we call “right”: well, we shall have to do them. But we are hoping
all the time that when all the demands have been met, the poor natural
self will still have some chance, and some time, to get on with its own
life and do what it likes. In fact, we are very like an honest man
paying his taxes. He pays them all right, but he does hope that there
will be enough left over for him to live on. Because we are still taking
our natural self as the starting point.
<br><br>
As long as we are thinking that way, one or other of two results is
likely to follow. Either we give up trying to be good, or else we become
very unhappy indeed. For, make no mistake: if you are really going to
try to meet all the demands made on the natural self, it will not have
enough left over to live on. The more you obey your conscience, the more
your conscience will demand of you. And your natural self, which is thus
being starved and hampered and worried at every turn, will get angrier
and angrier. In the end, you will either give up trying to be good, or
else become one of those people who, as they say, “live for others” but
always in a discontented, grumbling way—always wondering why the others
do not notice it more and always making a martyr of yourself. And once
you have become that you will be a far greater pest to anyone who has to
live with you than you would have been if you had remained frankly
selfish.
<br><br>
The Christian way is different: harder, and easier. Christ says “Give me
All. I don’t want so much of your time and so much of your money and so
much of your work: I want You. I have not come to torment your natural
self, but to kill it. No half-measures are any good. I don’t want to cut
off a branch here and a branch there, I want to have the whole tree
down. I don’t want to drill the tooth, or crown it, or stop it, but to
have it out. Hand over the whole natural self, all the desires which you
think innocent as well as the ones you think wicked—the whole outfit. I
will give you a new self instead. In fact, I will give you Myself: my
own will shall become yours.”
<br><br>
Both harder and easier than what we are all trying to do. You have
noticed, I expect, that Christ Himself sometimes describes the Christian
way as very hard, sometimes as very easy. He says, “Take up your
Cross”—in other words, it is like going to be beaten to death in a
concentration camp. Next minute he says, “My yoke is easy and my burden
light.” He means both. And one can just see why both are true.
<br><br>
Teachers will tell you that the laziest boy in the class is the one who
works hardest in the end. They mean this. If you give two boys, say, a
proposition in geometry to do, the one who is prepared to take trouble
will try to understand it. The lazy boy will try to learn it by heart
because, for the moment, that needs less effort. But six months later,
when they are preparing for an exam., that lazy boy is doing hours and
hours of miserable drudgery over things the other boy understands, and
positively enjoys, in a few minutes. Laziness means more work in the
long run. Or look at it this way. In a battle, or in mountain climbing,
there is often one thing which it takes a lot of pluck to do; but it is
also, in the long run, the safest thing to do. If you funk it, you will
find yourself, hours later, in far worse danger. The cowardly thing is
also the most dangerous thing.
<br><br>
It is like that here. The terrible thing, the almost impossible thing,
is to hand over your whole self—all your wishes and precautions—to
Christ. But it is far easier than what we are all trying to do instead.
For what we are trying to do is to remain what we call “ourselves,” to
keep personal happiness as our great aim in life, and yet at the same
time be “good.” We are all trying to let our mind and heart go their own
way—centred on money or pleasure or ambition—and hoping, in spite of
this, to behave honestly and chastely and humbly. And that is exactly
what Christ warned us you could not do. As He said, a thistle cannot
produce figs. If I am a field that contains nothing but grass-seed, I
cannot produce wheat. Cutting the grass may keep it short: but I shall
still produce grass and no wheat. If I want to produce wheat, the change
must go deeper than the surface. I must be ploughed up and re-sown.
<br><br>
That is why the real problem of the Christian life comes where people do
not usually look for it. It comes the very moment you wake up each
morning. All your wishes and hopes for the day rush at you like wild
animals. And the first job each morning consists simply in shoving them
all back; in listening to that other voice, taking that other point of
view, letting that other larger, stronger, quieter life come flowing in.
And so on, all day. Standing back from all your natural fussings and
frettings; coming in out of the wind.
<br><br>
We can only do it for moments at first. But from those moments the new
sort of life will be spreading through our system: because now we are
letting Him work at the right part of us. It is the difference between
paint, which is merely laid on the surface, and a dye or stain which
soaks right through. He never talked vague, idealistic gas. When he
said, “Be perfect,” He meant it. He meant that we must go in for the
full treatment. It is hard; but the sort of compromise we are all
hankering after is harder—in fact, it is impossible. It may be hard for
an egg to turn into a bird: it would be a jolly sight harder for it to
learn to fly while remaining an egg. We are like eggs at present. And
you cannot go on indefinitely being just an ordinary, decent egg. We
must be hatched or go bad.
<br><br>
May I come back to what I said before? This is the whole of
Christianity. There is nothing else. It is so easy to get muddled about
that. It is easy to think that the Church has a lot of different
objects—education, building, missions, holding services. Just as it is
easy to think the State has a lot of different objects—military,
political, economic, and what not. But in a way things are much simpler
than that. The State exists simply to promote and to protect the
ordinary happiness of human beings in this life. A husband and wife
chatting over a fire, a couple of friends having a game of darts in a
pub, a man reading a book in his own room or digging in his own
garden—that is what the State is there for. And unless they are helping
to increase and prolong and protect such moments, all the laws,
parliaments, armies, courts, police, economics, etc., are simply a waste
of time. In the same way the Church exists for nothing else but to draw
men into Christ, to make them little Christs. If they are not doing
that, all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible
itself, are simply a waste of time. God became Man for no other purpose.
It is even doubtful, you know, whether the whole universe was created
for any other purpose. It says in the Bible that the whole universe was
made for Christ and that everything is to be gathered together in Him. I
do not suppose any of us can understand how this will happen as regards
the whole universe. We do not know what (if anything) lives in the parts
of it that are millions of miles away from this Earth. Even on this
Earth we do not know how it applies to things other than men. After all,
that is what you would expect. We have been shown the plan only in so
far as it concerns ourselves.
<br><br>
I sometimes like to imagine that I can just see how it might apply to
other things. I think I can see how the higher animals are in a sense
drawn into Man when he loves them and makes them (as he does) much more
nearly human than they would otherwise be. I can even see a sense in
which the dead things and plants are drawn into Man as he studies them
and uses and appreciates them. And if there were intelligent creatures
in other worlds they might do the same with their worlds. It might be
that when intelligent creatures entered into Christ they would, in that
way, bring all the other things in along with them. But I do not know:
it is only a guess.
<br><br>
What we have been told is how we men can be drawn into Christ—can become
part of that wonderful present which the young Prince of the universe
wants to offer to His Father—that present which is Himself and therefore
us in Him. It is the only thing we were made for. And there are strange,
exciting hints in the Bible that when we are drawn in, a great many
other things in Nature will begin to come right. The bad dream will be
over: it will be morning.

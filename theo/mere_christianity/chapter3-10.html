                                  <p>HOPE</p>
<br><br>

Hope is one of the Theological virtues. This means that a continual
looking forward to the eternal world is not (as some modern people
think) a form of escapism or wishful thinking, but one of the things a
Christian is meant to do. It does not mean that we are to leave the
present world as it is. If you read history you will find that the
Christians who did most for the present world were just those who
thought most of the next. The Apostles themselves, who set on foot the
conversion of the Roman Empire, the great men who built up the Middle
Ages, the English Evangelicals who abolished the Slave Trade, all left
their mark on Earth, precisely because their minds were occupied with
Heaven. It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other
world that they have become so ineffective in this. Aim at Heaven and
you will get earth “thrown in”: aim at earth and you will get neither.
It seems a strange rule, but something like it can be seen at work in
other matters. Health is a great blessing, but the moment you make
health one of your main, direct objects you start becoming a crank and
imagining there is something wrong with you. You are only likely to get
health provided you want other things more—food, games, work, fun, open
air. In the same way, we shall never save civilisation as long as
civilisation is our main object. We must learn to want something else
even more.
<br><br>
Most of us find it very difficult to want “Heaven” at all—except in so
far as “Heaven” means meeting again our friends who have died. One
reason for this difficulty is that we have not been trained: our whole
education tends to fix our minds on this world. Another reason is that
when the real want for Heaven is present in us, we do not recognise it.
Most people, if they had really learned to look into their own hearts,
would know that they do want, and want acutely, something that cannot be
had in this world. There are all sorts of things in this world that
offer to give it to you, but they never quite keep their promise. The
longings which arise in us when we first fall in love, or first think of
some foreign country, or first take up some subject that excites us, are
longings which no marriage, no travel, no learning, can really satisfy.
I am not now speaking of what would be ordinarily called unsuccessful
marriages, or holidays, or learned careers. I am speaking of the best
possible ones. There was something we grasped at, in that first moment
of longing, which just fades away in the reality. I think everyone knows
what I mean. The wife may be a good wife, and the hotels and scenery may
have been excellent, and chemistry may be a very interesting job: but
something has evaded us. Now there are two wrong ways of dealing with
this fact, and one right one.
<br><br>
(1) The Fool’s Way.—He puts the blame on the things themselves. He goes
on all his life thinking that if only he tried another woman, or went
for a more expensive holiday, or whatever it is, then, this time, he
really would catch the mysterious something we are all after. Most of
the bored, discontented, rich people in the world are of this type. They
spend their whole lives trotting from woman to woman (through the
divorce courts), from continent to continent, from hobby to hobby,
always thinking that the latest is “the Real Thing” at last, and always
disappointed.
<br><br>
(2) The Way of the Disillusioned “Sensible Man.”—He soon decides that
the whole thing was moonshine. “Of course,” he says, “one feels like
that when one’s young. But by the time you get to my age you’ve given up
chasing the rainbow’s end.” And so he settles down and learns not to
expect too much and represses the part of himself which used, as he
would say, “to cry for the moon.” This is, of course, a much better way
than the first, and makes a man much happier, and less of a nuisance to
society. It tends to make him a prig (he is apt to be rather superior
towards what he calls “adolescents”), but, on the whole, he rubs along
fairly comfortably. It would be the best line we could take if man did
not live for ever. But supposing infinite happiness really is there,
waiting for us? Supposing one really can reach the rainbow’s end? In
that case it would be a pity to find out too late (a moment after death)
that by our supposed “common sense” we had stifled in ourselves the
faculty of enjoying it.
<br><br>
(3) The Christian Way.—The Christian says, “Creatures are not born with
desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels
hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim:
well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well,
there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no
experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is
that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures
satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably
earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it,
to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I must take care, on the one
hand, never to despise, or be unthankful for, these earthly blessings,
and on the other, never to mistake them for the something else of which
they are only a kind of copy, or echo, or mirage. I must keep alive in
myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after
death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make
it the main object of life to press on to that other country and to help
others to do the same.”
<br><br>
There is no need to be worried by facetious people who try to make the
Christian hope of “Heaven” ridiculous by saying they do not want “to
spend eternity playing harps.” The answer to such people is that if they
cannot understand books written for grown-ups, they should not talk
about them. All the scriptural imagery (harps, crowns, gold, etc.) is,
of course, a merely symbolical attempt to express the inexpressible.
Musical instruments are mentioned because for many people (not all)
music is the thing known in the present life which most strongly
suggests ecstasy and infinity. Crowns are mentioned to suggest the fact
that those who are united with God in eternity share His splendour and
power and joy. Gold is mentioned to suggest the timelessness of Heaven
(gold does not rust) and the preciousness of it. People who take these
symbols literally might as well think that when Christ told us to be
like doves, He meant that we were to lay eggs.

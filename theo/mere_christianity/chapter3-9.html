                                <p>CHARITY</p>
<br><br>

I said in an earlier chapter that there were four “Cardinal” virtues and
three “Theological” virtues. The three Theological ones are Faith, Hope,
and Charity. Faith is going to be dealt with in the last two chapters.
Charity was partly dealt with in Chapter 7, but there I concentrated on
that part of Charity which is called Forgiveness. I now want to add a
little more.
<br><br>
First, as to the meaning of the word. “Charity” now means simply what
used to be called “alms”—that is, giving to the poor. Originally it had
a much wider meaning. (You can see how it got the modern sense. If a man
has “charity,” giving to the poor is one of the most obvious things he
does, and so people came to talk as if that were the whole of charity.
In the same way, “rhyme” is the most obvious thing about poetry, and so
people come to mean by “poetry” simply rhyme and nothing more.) Charity
means “Love, in the Christian sense.” But love, in the Christian sense,
does not mean an emotion. It is a state not of the feelings but of the
will; that state of the will which we have naturally about ourselves,
and must learn to have about other people.
<br><br>
I pointed out in the chapter on Forgiveness that our love for ourselves
does not mean that we <i>like</i> ourselves. It means that we wish our own
good. In the same way Christian Love (or Charity) for our neighbours is
quite a different thing from liking or affection. We “like” or are “fond
of” some people, and not of others. It is important to understand that
this natural “liking” is neither a sin nor a virtue, any more than your
likes and dislikes in food are a sin or a virtue. It is just a fact.
But, of course, what we do about it is either sinful or virtuous.
<br><br>
Natural liking or affection for people makes it easier to be
“charitable” towards them. It is, therefore, normally a duty to
encourage our affections—to “like” people as much as we can (just as it
is often our duty to encourage our liking for exercise or wholesome
food)—not because this liking is itself the virtue of charity, but
because it is a help to it. On the other hand, it is also necessary to
keep a very sharp look-out for fear our liking for some one person makes
us uncharitable, or even unfair, to someone else. There are even cases
where our liking conflicts with our charity towards the person we like.
For example, a doting mother may be tempted by natural affection to
“spoil” her child; that is, to gratify her own affectionate impulses at
the expense of the child’s real happiness later on.
<br><br>
But though natural likings should normally be encouraged, it would be
quite wrong to think that the way to become charitable is to sit trying
to manufacture affectionate feelings. Some people are “cold” by
temperament; that may be a misfortune for them, but it is no more a sin
than having a bad digestion is a sin; and it does not cut them out from
the chance, or excuse them from the duty, of learning charity. The rule
for all of us is perfectly simple. Do not waste time bothering whether
you “love” your neighbour; act as if you did. As soon as we do this we
find one of the great secrets. When you are behaving as if you loved
someone, you will presently come to love him. If you injure someone you
dislike, you will find yourself disliking him more. If you do him a good
turn, you will find yourself disliking him less. There is, indeed, one
exception. If you do him a good turn, not to please God and obey the law
of charity, but to show him what a fine forgiving chap you are, and to
put him in your debt, and then sit down to wait for his “gratitude,” you
will probably be disappointed. (People are not fools: they have a very
quick eye for anything like showing off, or patronage.) But whenever we
do good to another self, just because it is a self, made (like us) by
God, and desiring its own happiness as we desire ours, we shall have
learned to love it a little more or, at least, to dislike it less.
<br><br>
Consequently, though Christian charity sounds a very cold thing to
people whose heads are full of sentimentality, and though it is quite
distinct from affection, yet it leads to affection. The difference
between a Christian and a worldly man is not that the worldly man has
only affections or “likings” and the Christian has only “charity.” The
worldly man treats certain people kindly because he “likes” them: the
Christian, trying to treat every one kindly, finds himself liking more
and more people as he goes on—including people he could not even have
imagined himself liking at the beginning.
<br><br>
This same spiritual law works terribly in the opposite direction. The
Germans, perhaps, at first ill-treated the Jews because they hated them:
afterwards they hated them much more because they had ill-treated them.
The more cruel you are, the more you will hate; and the more you hate,
the more cruel you will become—and so on in a vicious circle for ever.
<br><br>
Good and evil both increase at compound interest. That is why the little
decisions you and I make every day are of such infinite importance. The
smallest good act today is the capture of a strategic point from which,
a few months later, you may be able to go on to victories you never
dreamed of. An apparently trivial indulgence in lust or anger today is
the loss of a ridge or railway line or bridgehead from which the enemy
may launch an attack otherwise impossible.
<br><br>
Some writers use the word charity to describe not only Christian love
between human beings, but also God’s love for man and man’s love for
God. About the second of these two, people are often worried. They are
told they ought to love God. They cannot find any such feeling in
themselves. What are they to do? The answer is the same as before. Act
as if you did. Do not sit trying to manufacture feelings. Ask yourself,
“If I were sure that I loved God, what would I do?” When you have found
the answer, go and do it.
<br><br>
On the whole, God’s love for us is a much safer subject to think about
than our love for Him. Nobody can always have devout feelings: and even
if we could, feelings are not what God principally cares about.
Christian Love, either towards God or towards man, is an affair of the
will. If we are trying to do His will we are obeying the commandment,
“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.” He will give us feelings of love if
He pleases. We cannot create them for ourselves, and we must not demand
them as a right. But the great thing to remember is that, though our
feelings come and go, His love for us does not. It is not wearied by our
sins, or our indifference; and, therefore, it is quite relentless in its
determination that we shall be cured of those sins, at whatever cost to
us, at whatever cost to Him.

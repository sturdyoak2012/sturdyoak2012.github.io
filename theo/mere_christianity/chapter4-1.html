                          <p>MAKING AND BEGETTING</p>
<br><br>

Everyone has warned me not to tell you what I am going to tell you in
this last book. They all say “the ordinary reader does not want
Theology; give him plain practical religion.” I have rejected their
advice. I do not think the ordinary reader is such a fool. Theology
means “the science of God,” and I think any man who wants to think about
God at all would like to have the clearest and most accurate ideas about
Him which are available. You are not children: why should you be treated
like children?
<br><br>
In a way I quite understand why some people are put off by Theology. I
remember once when I had been giving a talk to the R.A.F., an old,
hard-bitten officer got up and said, “I’ve no use for all that stuff.
But, mind you, I’m a religious man too. I know there’s a God. I’ve felt
Him: out alone in the desert at night: the tremendous mystery. And
that’s just why I don’t believe all your neat little dogmas and formulas
about Him. To anyone who’s met the real thing they all seem so petty and
pedantic and unreal!”
<br><br>
Now in a sense I quite agreed with that man. I think he had probably had
a real experience of God in the desert. And when he turned from that
experience to the Christian creeds, I think he really was turning from
something real to something less real. In the same way, if a man has
once looked at the Atlantic from the beach, and then goes and looks at a
map of the Atlantic, he also will be turning from something real to
something less real: turning from real waves to a bit of coloured paper.
But here comes the point. The map is admittedly only coloured paper, but
there are two things you have to remember about it. In the first place,
it is based on what hundreds and thousands of people have found out by
sailing the real Atlantic. In that way it has behind it masses of
experience just as real as the one you could have from the beach; only,
while yours would be a single isolated glimpse, the map fits all those
different experiences together. In the second place, if you want to go
anywhere, the map is absolutely necessary. As long as you are content
with walks on the beach, your own glimpses are far more fun than looking
at a map. But the map is going to be more use than walks on the beach if
you want to get to America.
<br><br>
Now, Theology is like the map. Merely learning and thinking about the
Christian doctrines, if you stop there, is less real and less exciting
than the sort of thing my friend got in the desert. Doctrines are not
God: they are only a kind of map. But that map is based on the
experience of hundreds of people who really were in touch with
God—experiences compared with which any thrills or pious feelings you
and I are likely to get on our own are very elementary and very
confused. And secondly, if you want to get any further, you must use the
map. You see, what happened to that man in the desert may have been
real, and was certainly exciting, but nothing comes of it. It leads
nowhere. There is nothing to do about it. In fact, that is just why a
vague religion—all about feeling God in nature, and so on—is so
attractive. It is all thrills and no work; like watching the waves from
the beach. But you will not get to Newfoundland by studying the Atlantic
that way, and you will not get eternal life by simply feeling the
presence of God in flowers or music. Neither will you get anywhere by
looking at maps without going to sea. Nor will you be very safe if you
go to sea without a map.
<br><br>
In other words, Theology is practical: especially now. In the old days,
when there was less education and discussion, perhaps it was possible to
get on with a very few simple ideas about God. But it is not so now.
Everyone reads, everyone hears things discussed. Consequently, if you do
not listen to Theology, that will not mean that you have no ideas about
God. It will mean that you have a lot of wrong ones—bad, muddled,
out-of-date ideas. For a great many of the ideas about God which are
trotted out as novelties today are simply the ones which real
Theologians tried centuries ago and rejected. To believe in the popular
religion of modern England is retrogression—like believing the earth is
flat.
<br><br>
For when you get down to it, is not the popular idea of Christianity
simply this: that Jesus Christ was a great moral teacher and that if
only we took His advice we might be able to establish a better social
order and avoid another war? Now, mind you, that is quite true. But it
tells you much less than the whole truth about Christianity and it has
no practical importance at all.
<br><br>
It is quite true that if we took Christ’s advice we should soon be
living in a happier world. You need not even go as far as Christ. If we
did all that Plato or Aristotle or Confucius told us, we should get on a
great deal better than we do. And so what? We never have followed the
advice of the great teachers. Why are we likely to begin now? Why are we
more likely to follow Christ than any of the others? Because He is the
best moral teacher? But that makes it even less likely that we shall
follow Him. If we cannot take the elementary lessons, is it likely we
are going to take the most advanced one? If Christianity only means one
more bit of good advice, then Christianity is of no importance. There
has been no lack of good advice for the last four thousand years. A bit
more makes no difference.
<br><br>
But as soon as you look at any real Christian writings, you find that
they are talking about something quite different from this popular
religion. They say that Christ is the Son of God (whatever that means).
They say that those who give Him their confidence can also become Sons
of God (whatever that means). They say that His death saved us from our
sins (whatever that means).
<br><br>
There is no good complaining that these statements are difficult.
Christianity claims to be telling us about another world, about
something behind the world we can touch and hear and see. You may think
the claim false; but if it were true, what it tells us would be bound to
be difficult—at least as difficult as modern Physics, and for the same
reason.
<br><br>
Now the point in Christianity which gives us the greatest shock is the
statement that by attaching ourselves to Christ, we can “become Sons of
God.” One asks “Aren’t we Sons of God already? Surely the fatherhood of
God is one of the main Christian ideas?” Well, in a certain sense, no
doubt we are sons of God already. I mean, God has brought us into
existence and loves us and looks after us, and in that way is like a
father. But when the Bible talks of our “becoming” Sons of God,
obviously it must mean something different. And that brings us up
against the very centre of Theology.
<br><br>
One of the creeds says that Christ is the Son of God “begotten, not
created”; and it adds “begotten by his Father before all worlds.” Will
you please get it quite clear that this has nothing to do with the fact
that when Christ was born on earth as a man, that man was the son of a
virgin? We are not now thinking about the Virgin Birth. We are thinking
about something that happened before Nature was created at all, before
time began. “Before all worlds” Christ is begotten, not created. What
does it mean?
<br><br>
We don’t use the words <i>begetting</i> or <i>begotten</i> much in modern English,
but everyone still knows what they mean. To beget is to become the
father of: to create is to make. And the difference is this. When you
beget, you beget something of the same kind as yourself. A man begets
human babies, a beaver begets little beavers and a bird begets eggs
which turn into little birds. But when you make, you make something of a
different kind from yourself. A bird makes a nest, a beaver builds a
dam, a man makes a wireless set—or he may make something more like
himself than a wireless set: say, a statue. If he is a clever enough
carver he may make a statue which is very like a man indeed. But, of
course, it is not a real man; it only looks like one. It cannot breathe
or think. It is not alive.
<br><br>
Now that is the first thing to get clear. What God begets is God; just
as what man begets is man. What God creates is not God; just as what man
makes is not man. That is why men are not Sons of God in the sense that
Christ is. They may be like God in certain ways, but they are not things
of the same kind. They are more like statues or pictures of God.
<br><br>
A statue has the shape of a man but it is not alive. In the same way,
man has (in a sense I am going to explain) the “shape” or likeness of
God, but he has not got the kind of life God has. Let us take the first
point (man’s resemblance to God) first. Everything God has made has some
likeness to Himself. Space is like Him in its hugeness: not that the
greatness of space is the same kind of greatness as God’s, but it is a
sort of symbol of it, or a translation of it into non-spiritual terms.
Matter is like God in having energy: though, again, of course, physical
energy is a different kind of thing from the power of God. The vegetable
world is like Him because it is alive, and He is the “living God.” But
life, in this biological sense, is not the same as the life there is in
God: it is only a kind of symbol or shadow of it. When we come on to the
animals, we find other kinds of resemblance in addition to biological
life. The intense activity and fertility of the insects, for example, is
a first dim resemblance to the unceasing activity and the creativeness
of God. In the higher mammals we get the beginnings of instinctive
affection. That is not the same thing as the love that exists in God:
but it is like it—rather in the way that a picture drawn on a flat piece
of paper can nevertheless be “like” a landscape. When we come to man,
the highest of the animals, we get the completest resemblance to God
which we know of. (There may be creatures in other worlds who are more
like God than man is, but we do not know about them.) Man not only
lives, but loves and reasons: biological life reaches its highest known
level in him.
<br><br>
But what man, in his natural condition, has not got, is Spiritual
life—the higher and different sort of life that exists in God. We use
the same word <i>life</i> for both: but if you thought that both must
therefore be the same sort of thing, that would be like thinking that
the “greatness” of space and the “greatness” of God were the same sort
of greatness. In reality, the difference between Biological life and
Spiritual life is so important that I am going to give them two distinct
names. The Biological sort which comes to us through Nature, and which
(like everything else in Nature) is always tending to run down and decay
so that it can only be kept up by incessant subsidies from Nature in the
form of air, water, food, etc., is <i>Bios</i>. The Spiritual life which is
in God from all eternity, and which made the whole natural universe, is
<i>Zoe</i>. <i>Bios</i> has, to be sure, a certain shadowy or symbolic resemblance
to <i>Zoe</i>: but only the sort of resemblance there is between a photo and
a place, or a statue and a man. A man who changed from having <i>Bios</i> to
having <i>Zoe</i> would have gone through as big a change as a statue which
changed from being a carved stone to being a real man.
<br><br>
And that is precisely what Christianity is about. This world is a great
sculptor’s shop. We are the statues and there is a rumour going round
the shop that some of us are some day going to come to life.

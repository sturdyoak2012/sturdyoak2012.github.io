                      <p>THE RIVAL CONCEPTIONS OF GOD</p>
<br><br>

I have been asked to tell you what Christians believe, and I am going to
begin by telling you one thing that Christians do not need to believe.
If you are a Christian you do not have to believe that all the other
religions are simply wrong all through. If you are an atheist you do
have to believe that the main point in all the religions of the whole
world is simply one huge mistake. If you are a Christian, you are free
to think that all these religions, even the queerest ones, contain at
least some hint of the truth. When I was an atheist I had to try to
persuade myself that most of the human race have always been wrong about
the question that mattered to them most; when I became a Christian I was
able to take a more liberal view. But, of course, being a Christian does
mean thinking that where Christianity differs from other religions,
Christianity is right and they are wrong. As in arithmetic—there is only
one right answer to a sum, and all other answers are wrong: but some of
the wrong answers are much nearer being right than others.
<br><br>
The first big division of humanity is into the majority, who believe in
some kind of God or gods, and the minority who do not. On this point,
Christianity lines up with the majority—lines up with ancient Greeks and
Romans, modern savages, Stoics, Platonists, Hindus, Mohammedans, etc.,
against the modern Western European materialist.
<br><br>
Now I go on to the next big division. People who all believe in God can
be divided according to the sort of God they believe in. There are two
very different ideas on this subject. One of them is the idea that He is
beyond good and evil. We humans call one thing good and another thing
bad. But according to some people that is merely our human point of
view. These people would say that the wiser you become the less you
would want to call anything good or bad, and the more clearly you would
see that everything is good in one way and bad in another, and that
nothing could have been different. Consequently, these people think that
long before you got anywhere near the divine point of view the
distinction would have disappeared altogether. We call a cancer bad,
they would say, because it kills a man; but you might just as well call
a successful surgeon bad because he kills a cancer. It all depends on
the point of view. The other and opposite idea is that God is quite
definitely “good” or “righteous,” a God who takes sides, who loves love
and hates hatred, who wants us to behave in one way and not in another.
The first of these views—the one that thinks God beyond good and evil—is
called Pantheism. It was held by the great Prussian philosopher Hegel
and, as far as I can understand them, by the Hindus. The other view is
held by Jews, Mohammedans and Christians.
<br><br>
And with this big difference between Pantheism and the Christian idea of
God, there usually goes another. Pantheists usually believe that God, so
to speak, animates the universe as you animate your body: that the
universe almost <i>is</i> God, so that if it did not exist He would not exist
either, and anything you find in the universe is a part of God. The
Christian idea is quite different. They think God invented and made the
universe—like a man making a picture or composing a tune. A painter is
not a picture, and he does not die if his picture is destroyed. You may
say, “He’s put a lot of himself into it,” but you only mean that all its
beauty and interest has come out of his head. His skill is not in the
picture in the same way that it is in his head, or even in his hands. I
expect you see how this difference between Pantheists and Christians
hangs together with the other one. If you do not take the distinction
between good and bad very seriously, then it is easy to say that
anything you find in this world is a part of God. But, of course, if you
think some things really bad, and God really good, then you cannot talk
like that. You must believe that God is separate from the world and that
some of the things we see in it are contrary to His will. Confronted
with a cancer or a slum the Pantheist can say, “If you could only see it
from the divine point of view, you would realise that this also is God.”
The Christian replies, “Don’t talk damned nonsense.”[3] For Christianity
is a fighting religion. It thinks God made the world—that space and
time, heat and cold, and all the colours and tastes, and all the animals
and vegetables, are things that God “made up out of His head” as a man
makes up a story. But it also thinks that a great many things have gone
wrong with the world that God made and that God insists, and insists
very loudly, on our putting them right again.
<br><br>
And, of course, that raises a very big question. If a good God made the
world why has it gone wrong? And for many years I simply refused to
listen to the Christian answers to this question, because I kept on
feeling “whatever you say, and however clever your arguments are, isn’t
it much simpler and easier to say that the world was not made by any
intelligent power? Aren’t all your arguments simply a complicated
attempt to avoid the obvious?” But then that threw me back into another
difficulty.
<br><br>
My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and
unjust. But how had I got this idea of <i>just</i> and <i>unjust</i>? A man does
not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What
was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole
show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so to speak, why did I, who was
supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such violent reaction
against it? A man feels wet when he falls into water, because man is not
a water animal: a fish would not feel wet. Of course I could have given
up my idea of justice by saying it was nothing but a private idea of my
own. But if I did that, then my argument against God collapsed too—for
the argument depended on saying that the world was really unjust, not
simply that it did not happen to please my private fancies. Thus in the
very act of trying to prove that God did not exist—in other words, that
the whole of reality was senseless—I found I was forced to assume that
one part of reality—namely my idea of justice—was full of sense.
Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe
has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning:
just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no
creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. <i>Dark</i> would be a
word without meaning.

                        <p> THE “CARDINAL VIRTUES”</p>
<br><br>

The previous section was originally composed to be given as a short talk
on the air.
<br><br>
If you are allowed to talk for only ten minutes, pretty well everything
else has to be sacrificed to brevity. One of my chief reasons for
dividing morality up into three parts (with my picture of the ships
sailing in convoy) was that this seemed the shortest way of covering the
ground. Here I want to give some idea of another way in which the
subject has been divided by old writers, which was too long to use in my
talk, but which is a very good one.
<br><br>
According to this longer scheme there are seven “virtues.” Four of them
are called “Cardinal” virtues, and the remaining three are called
“Theological” virtues. The “Cardinal” ones are those which all civilised
people recognise: the “Theological” are those which, as a rule, only
Christians know about. I shall deal with the Theological ones later on:
at present I am talking about the four Cardinal virtues. (The word
“cardinal” has nothing to do with “Cardinals” in the Roman Church. It
comes from a Latin word meaning “the hinge of a door.” These were called
“cardinal” virtues because they are, as we should say, “pivotal.”) They
are Prudence, Temperance, Justice, and Fortitude.
<br><br>
Prudence means practical common sense, taking the trouble to think out
what you are doing and what is likely to come of it. Nowadays most
people hardly think of Prudence as one of the “virtues.” In fact,
because Christ said we could only get into His world by being like
children, many Christians have the idea that, provided you are “good,”
it does not matter being a fool. But that is a misunderstanding. In the
first place, most children show plenty of “prudence” about doing the
things they are really interested in, and think them out quite sensibly.
In the second place, as St. Paul points out, Christ never meant that we
were to remain children in <i>intelligence</i>: on the contrary, He told us
to be not only “as harmless as doves,” but also “as wise as serpents.”
He wants a child’s heart, but a grown-up’s head. He wants us to be
simple, single-minded, affectionate, and teachable, as good children
are; but He also wants every bit of intelligence we have to be alert at
its job, and in first-class fighting trim. The fact that you are giving
money to a charity does not mean that you need not try to find out
whether that charity is a fraud or not. The fact that what you are
thinking about is God Himself (for example, when you are praying) does
not mean that you can be content with the same babyish ideas which you
had when you were a five-year old. It is, of course, quite true that God
will not love you any the less, or have less use for you, if you happen
to have been born with a very second-rate brain. He has room for people
with very little sense, but He wants every one to use what sense they
have. The proper motto is not “Be good, sweet maid, and let who can be
clever,” but “Be good, sweet maid, and don’t forget that this involves
being as clever as you can.” God is no fonder of intellectual slackers
than of any other slackers. If you are thinking of becoming a Christian,
I warn you you are embarking on something which is going to take the
whole of you, brains and all. But, fortunately, it works the other way
round. Anyone who is honestly trying to be a Christian will soon find
his intelligence being sharpened: one of the reasons why it needs no
special education to be a Christian is that Christianity is an education
itself. That is why an uneducated believer like Bunyan was able to write
a book that has astonished the whole world.
<br><br>
Temperance is, unfortunately, one of those words that has changed its
meaning. It now usually means teetotalism. But in the days when the
second Cardinal virtue was christened “Temperance,” it meant nothing of
the sort. Temperance referred not specially to drink, but to all
pleasures; and it meant not abstaining, but going the right length and
no further. It is a mistake to think that Christians ought all to be
teetotallers; Mohammedanism, not Christianity, is the teetotal religion.
Of course it may be the duty of a particular Christian, or of any
Christian, at a particular time, to abstain from strong drink, either
because he is the sort of man who cannot drink at all without drinking
too much, or because he wants to give the money to the poor, or because
he is with people who are inclined to drunkenness and must not encourage
them by drinking himself. But the whole point is that he is abstaining,
for a good reason, from something which he does not condemn and which he
likes to see other people enjoying. One of the marks of a certain type
of bad man is that he cannot give up a thing himself without wanting
every one else to give it up. That is not the Christian way. An
individual Christian may see fit to give up all sorts of things for
special reasons—marriage, or meat, or beer, or the cinema; but the
moment he starts saying the things are bad in themselves, or looking
down his nose at other people who do use them, he has taken the wrong
turning.<br><br><br><br>

One great piece of mischief has been done by the modern restriction of
the word Temperance to the question of drink. It helps people to forget
that you can be just as intemperate about lots of other things. A man
who makes his golf or his motor-bicycle the centre of his life, or a
woman who devotes all her thoughts to clothes or bridge or her dog, is
being just as “intemperate” as someone who gets drunk every evening. Of
course, it does not show on the outside so easily: bridge-mania or
golf-mania do not make you fall down in the middle of the road. But God
is not deceived by externals.
<br><br>
Justice means much more than the sort of thing that goes on in law
courts. It is the old name for everything we should now call “fairness”;
it includes honesty, give and take, truthfulness, keeping promises, and
all that side of life. And Fortitude includes both kinds of courage—the
kind that faces danger as well as the kind that “sticks it” under pain.
“Guts” is perhaps the nearest modern English. You will notice, of
course, that you cannot practise any of the other virtues very long
without bringing this one into play.
<br><br>
There is one further point about the virtues that ought to be noticed.
There is a difference between doing some particular just or temperate
action and being a just or temperate man. Someone who is not a good
tennis player may now and then make a good shot. What you mean by a good
player is the man whose eye and muscles and nerves have been so trained
by making innumerable good shots that they can now be relied on. They
have a certain tone or quality which is there even when he is not
playing, just as a mathematician’s mind has a certain habit and outlook
which is there even when he is not doing mathematics. In the same way a
man who perseveres in doing just actions gets in the end a certain
quality of character. Now it is that quality rather than the particular
actions which we mean when we talk of a “virtue.”
<br><br>
This distinction is important for the following reason. If we thought
only of the particular actions we might encourage three wrong ideas.
<br><br>
(1) We might think that, provided you did the right thing, it did not
matter how or why you did it—whether you did it willingly or
unwillingly, sulkily or cheerfully, through fear of public opinion or
for its own sake. But the truth is that right actions done for the wrong
reason do not help to build the internal quality or character called a
“virtue,” and it is this quality or character that really matters. (If
the bad tennis player hits very hard, not because he sees that a very
hard stroke is required, but because he has lost his temper, his stroke
might possibly, by luck, help him to win that particular game; but it
will not be helping him to become a reliable player.)
<br><br>
(2) We might think that God wanted simply obedience to a set of rules:
whereas He really wants people of a particular sort.
<br><br>
(3) We might think that the “virtue” were necessary only for this
present life—that in the other world we could stop being just because
there is nothing to quarrel about and stop being brave because there is
no danger. Now it is quite true that there will probably be no occasion
for just or courageous acts in the next world, but there will be every
occasion for being the sort of people that we can become only as the
result of doing such acts here. The point is not that God will refuse
you admission to His eternal world if you have not got certain qualities
of character: the point is that if people have not got at least the
beginnings of those qualities inside them, then no possible external
conditions could make a “Heaven” for them—that is, could make them happy
with the deep, strong, unshakable kind of happiness God intends for us.

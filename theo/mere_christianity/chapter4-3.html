<br><br>

It is a very silly idea that in reading a book you must never “skip.”
All sensible people skip freely when they come to a chapter which they
find is going to be no use to them. In this chapter I am going to talk
about something which may be helpful to some readers, but which may seem
to others merely an unnecessary complication. If you are one of the
second sort of readers, then I advise you not to bother about this
chapter at all but to turn on to the next.
<br><br>
In the last chapter I had to touch on the subject of prayer, and while
that is still fresh in your mind and my own, I should like to deal with
a difficulty that some people find about the whole idea of prayer. A man
put it to me by saying “I can believe in God all right, but what I
cannot swallow is the idea of Him attending to several hundred million
human beings who are all addressing Him at the same moment.” And I have
found that quite a lot of people feel this.
<br><br>
Now, the first thing to notice is that the whole sting of it comes in
the words <i>at the same moment</i>. Most of us can imagine God attending to
any number of applicants if only they came one by one and He had an
endless time to do it in. So what is really at the back of this
difficulty is the idea of God having to fit too many things into one
moment of time.
<br><br>
Well that is of course what happens to us. Our life comes to us moment
by moment. One moment disappears before the next comes along: and there
is room for very little in each. That is what Time is like. And of
course you and I tend to take it for granted that this Time series—this
arrangement of past, present and future—is not simply the way life comes
to us but the way all things really exist. We tend to assume that the
whole universe and God Himself are always moving on from past to future
just as we do. But many learned men do not agree with that. It was the
Theologians who first started the idea that some things are not in Time
at all: later the Philosophers took it over: and now some of the
scientists are doing the same.
<br><br>
Almost certainly God is not in Time. His life does not consist of
moments following one another. If a million people are praying to Him at
ten-thirty tonight, He need not listen to them all in that one little
snippet which we call ten-thirty. Ten-thirty—and every other moment from
the beginning of the world—is always the Present for Him. If you like to
put it that way, He has all eternity in which to listen to the split
second of prayer put up by a pilot as his plane crashes in flames.
<br><br>
That is difficult, I know. Let me try to give something, not the same,
but a bit like it. Suppose I am writing a novel. I write “Mary laid down
her work; next moment came a knock at the door!” For Mary who has to
live in the imaginary time of my story there is no interval between
putting down the work and hearing the knock. But I, who am Mary’s maker,
do not live in that imaginary time at all. Between writing the first
half of that sentence and the second, I might sit down for three hours
and think steadily about Mary. I could think about Mary as if she were
the only character in the book and for as long as I pleased, and the
hours I spent in doing so would not appear in Mary’s time (the time
inside the story) at all.
<br><br>
This is not a perfect illustration, of course. But it may give just a
glimpse of what I believe to be the truth. God is not hurried along in
the Time-stream of this universe any more than an author is hurried
along in the imaginary time of his own novel. He has infinite attention
to spare for each one of us. He does not have to deal with us in the
mass. You are as much alone with Him as if you were the only being He
had ever created. When Christ died, He died for you individually just as
much as if you had been the only man in the world.
<br><br>
The way in which my illustration breaks down is this. In it the author
gets out of one Time-series (that of the novel) only by going into
another Time-series (the real one). But God, I believe, does not live in
a Time-series at all. His life is not dribbled out moment by moment like
ours: with Him it is, so to speak, still 1920 and already 1960. For His
life is Himself.
<br><br>
If you picture Time as a straight line along which we have to travel,
then you must picture God as the whole page on which the line is drawn.
We come to the parts of the line one by one: we have to leave A behind
before we get to B, and cannot reach C until we leave B behind. God,
from above or outside or all round, contains the whole line, and sees it
all.
<br><br>
The idea is worth trying to grasp because it removes some apparent
difficulties in Christianity. Before I became a Christian one of my
objections was as follows. The Christians said that the eternal God who
is everywhere and keeps the whole universe going, once became a human
being. Well then, said I, how did the whole universe keep going while He
was a baby, or while He was asleep? How could He at the same time be God
who knows everything and also a man asking his disciples “Who touched
me?” You will notice that the sting lay in the <i>time</i> words: “<i>While</i> He
was a baby”—“How could He <i>at the same time</i>?” In other words I was
assuming that Christ’s life as God was in time, and that His life as the
man Jesus in Palestine was a shorter period taken out of that time—just
as my service in the army was a shorter period taken out of my total
life. And that is how most of us perhaps tend to think about it. We
picture God living through a period when His human life was still in the
future: then coming to a period when it was present: then going on to a
period when He could look back on it as something in the past. But
probably these ideas correspond to nothing in the actual facts. You
cannot fit Christ’s earthly life in Palestine into any time-relations
with His life as God beyond all space and time. It is really, I suggest,
a timeless truth about God that human nature, and the human experience
of weakness and sleep and ignorance, are somehow included in His whole
divine life. This human life in God is from our point of view a
particular period in the history of our world (from the year A.D. one
till the Crucifixion). We therefore imagine it is also a period in the
history of God’s own existence. But God has no history. He is too
completely and utterly real to have one. For, of course, to have a
history means losing part of your reality (because it has already
slipped away into the past) and not yet having another part (because it
is still in the future): in fact having nothing but the tiny little
present, which has gone before you can speak about it. God forbid we
should think God was like that. Even we may hope not to be always
rationed in that way.
<br><br>
Another difficulty we get if we believe God to be in time is this.
Everyone who believes in God at all believes that He knows what you and
I are going to do tomorrow. But if He knows I am going to do so-and-so,
how can I be free to do otherwise? Well, here once again, the difficulty
comes from thinking that God is progressing along the Time-line like us:
the only difference being that He can see ahead and we cannot. Well, if
that were true, if God <i>foresaw</i> our acts, it would be very hard to
understand how we could be free not to do them. But suppose God is
outside and above the Time-line. In that case, what we call “tomorrow”
is visible to Him in just the same way as what we call “today.” All the
days are “Now” for Him. He does not remember you doing things yesterday;
He simply sees you doing them, because, though you have lost yesterday,
He has not. He does not “foresee” you doing things tomorrow; He simply
sees you doing them: because, though tomorrow is not yet there for you,
it is for Him. You never supposed that your actions at this moment were
any less free because God knows what you are doing. Well, He knows your
tomorrow’s actions in just the same way—because He is already in
tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He does not know your
action till you have done it: but then the moment at which you have done
it is already “Now” for Him.
<br><br>
This idea has helped me a good deal. If it does not help you, leave it
alone. It is a “Christian idea” in the sense that great and wise
Christians have held it and there is nothing in it contrary to
Christianity. But it is not in the Bible or any of the creeds. You can
be a perfectly good Christian without accepting it, or indeed without
thinking of the matter at all.

                        <p> THE THREE-PERSONAL GOD</p>
<br><br>

The last chapter was about the difference between begetting and making.
A man begets a child, but he only makes a statue. God begets Christ but
He only makes men. But by saying that, I have illustrated only one point
about God, namely, that what God the Father begets is God, something of
the same kind as Himself. In that way it is like a human father
begetting a human son. But not quite like it. So I must try to explain a
little more.
<br><br>
A good many people nowadays say, “I believe in a God, but not in a
personal God.” They feel that the mysterious something which is behind
all other things must be more than a person. Now the Christians quite
agree. But the Christians are the only people who offer any idea of what
a being that is beyond personality could be like. All the other people,
though they say that God is beyond personality, really think of Him as
something impersonal: that is, as something less than personal. If you
are looking for something super-personal, something more than a person,
then it is not a question of choosing between the Christian idea and the
other ideas. The Christian idea is the only one on the market.
<br><br>
Again, some people think that after this life, or perhaps after several
lives, human souls will be “absorbed” into God. But when they try to
explain what they mean, they seem to be thinking of our being absorbed
into God as one material thing is absorbed into another. They say it is
like a drop of water slipping into the sea. But of course that is the
end of the drop. If that is what happens to us, then being absorbed is
the same as ceasing to exist. It is only the Christians who have any
idea of how human souls can be taken into the life of God and yet remain
themselves—in fact, be very much more themselves than they were before.
<br><br>
I warned you that Theology is practical. The whole purpose for which we
exist is to be thus taken into the life of God. Wrong ideas about what
that life is will make it harder. And now, for a few minutes, I must ask
you to follow rather carefully.
<br><br>
You know that in space you can move in three ways—to left or right,
backwards or forwards, up or down. Every direction is either one of
these three or a compromise between them. They are called the three
Dimensions. Now notice this. If you are using only one dimension, you
could draw only a straight line. If you are using two, you could draw a
figure: say, a square. And a square is made up of four straight lines.
Now a step further. If you have three dimensions, you can then build
what we call a solid body: say, a cube—a thing like a dice or a lump of
sugar. And a cube is made up of six squares.
<br><br>
Do you see the point? A world of one dimension would be a straight line.
In a two-dimensional world, you still get straight lines, but many lines
make one figure. In a three-dimensional world, you still get figures but
many figures make one solid body. In other words, as you advance to more
real and more complicated levels, you do not leave behind you the things
you found on the simpler levels: you still have them, but combined in
new ways—in ways you could not imagine if you knew only the simpler
levels.
<br><br>
Now the Christian account of God involves just the same principle. The
human level is a simple and rather empty level. On the human level one
person is one being, and any two persons are two separate beings—just
as, in two dimensions (say on a flat sheet of paper) one square is one
figure, and any two squares are two separate figures. On the Divine
level you still find personalities; but up there you find them combined
in new ways which we, who do not live on that level, cannot imagine. In
God’s dimension, so to speak, you find a being who is three Persons
while remaining one Being, just as a cube is six squares while remaining
one cube. Of course we cannot fully conceive a Being like that: just as,
if we were so made that we perceived only two dimensions in space we
could never properly imagine a cube. But we can get a sort of faint
notion of it. And when we do, we are then, for the first time in our
lives, getting some positive idea, however faint, of something
super-personal—something more than a person. It is something we could
never have guessed, and yet, once we have been told, one almost feels
one ought to have been able to guess it because it fits in so well with
all the things we know already.
<br><br>
You may ask, “If we cannot imagine a three-personal Being, what is the
good of talking about Him?” Well, there isn’t any good talking about
Him. The thing that matters is being actually drawn into that
three-personal life, and that may begin any time—tonight, if you like.
<br><br>
What I mean is this. An ordinary simple Christian kneels down to say his
prayers. He is trying to get into touch with God. But if he is a
Christian he knows that what is prompting him to pray is also God: God,
so to speak, inside him. But he also knows that all his real knowledge
of God comes through Christ, the Man who was God—that Christ is standing
beside him, helping him to pray, praying for him. You see what is
happening. God is the thing to which he is praying—the goal he is trying
to reach. God is also the thing inside him which is pushing him on—the
motive power. God is also the road or bridge along which he is being
pushed to that goal. So that the whole threefold life of the
three-personal Being is actually going on in that ordinary little
bedroom where an ordinary man is saying his prayers. The man is being
caught up into the higher kind of life—what I called <i>Zoe</i> or spiritual
life: he is being pulled into God, by God, while still remaining
himself.
<br><br>
And that is how Theology started. People already knew about God in a
vague way. Then came a man who claimed to be God; and yet He was not the
sort of man you could dismiss as a lunatic. He made them believe Him.
They met Him again after they had seen Him killed. And then, after they
had been formed into a little society or community, they found God
somehow inside them as well: directing them, making them able to do
things they could not do before. And when they worked it all out they
found they had arrived at the Christian definition of the three-personal
God.
<br><br>
This definition is not something we have made up; Theology is, in a
sense, an experimental science. It is the simple religions that are the
made-up ones. When I say it is an experimental science “in a sense,” I
mean that it is like the other experimental sciences in some ways, but
not in all. If you are a geologist studying rocks, you have to go and
find the rocks. They will not come to you, and if you go to them they
cannot run away. The initiative lies all on your side. They cannot
either help or hinder. But suppose you are a zoologist and want to take
photos of wild animals in their native haunts. That is a bit different
from studying rocks. The wild animals will not come to you: but they can
run away from you. Unless you keep very quiet, they will. There is
beginning to be a tiny little trace of initiative on their side.
<br><br>
Now a stage higher; suppose you want to get to know a human person. If
he is determined not to let you, you will not get to know him. You have
to win his confidence. In this case the initiative is equally divided—it
takes two to make a friendship.
<br><br>
When you come to knowing God, the initiative lies on His side. If He
does not show Himself, nothing you can do will enable you to find Him.
And, in fact, He shows much more of Himself to some people than to
others—not because He has favourites, but because it is impossible for
Him to show Himself to a man whose whole mind and character are in the
wrong condition. Just as sunlight, though it has no favourites, cannot
be reflected in a dusty mirror as clearly as in a clean one.
<br><br>
You can put this another way by saying that while in other sciences the
instruments you use are things external to yourself (things like
microscopes and telescopes), the instrument through which you see God is
your whole self. And if a man’s self is not kept clean and bright, his
glimpse of God will be blurred—like the Moon seen through a dirty
telescope. That is why horrible nations have horrible religions: they
have been looking at God through a dirty lens.
<br><br>
God can show Himself as He really is only to real men. And that means
not simply to men who are individually good, but to men who are united
together in a body, loving one another, helping one another, showing Him
to one another. For that is what God meant humanity to be like; like
players in one band, or organs in one body.
<br><br>
Consequently, the one really adequate instrument for learning about God
is the whole Christian community, waiting for Him together. Christian
brotherhood is, so to speak, the technical equipment for this
science—the laboratory outfit. That is why all these people who turn up
every few years with some patent simplified religion of their own as a
substitute for the Christian tradition are really wasting time. Like a
man who has no instrument but an old pair of field glasses setting out
to put all the real astronomers right. He may be a clever chap—he may be
cleverer than some of the real astronomers, but he is not giving himself
a chance. And two years later everyone has forgotten all about him, but
the real science is still going on.
<br><br>
If Christianity was something we were making up, of course we could make
it easier. But it is not. We cannot compete, in simplicity, with people
who are inventing religions. How could we? We are dealing with Fact. Of
course anyone can be simple if he has no facts to bother about.

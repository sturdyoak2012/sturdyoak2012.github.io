                       <p>THE OBSTINATE TOY SOLDIERS</p>
<br><br>

The Son of God became a man to enable men to become sons of God. We do
not know—anyway, I do not know—how things would have worked if the human
race had never rebelled against God and joined the enemy. Perhaps every
man would have been “in Christ,” would have shared the life of the Son
of God, from the moment he was born. Perhaps the <i>Bios</i> or natural life
would have been drawn up into the <i>Zoe</i>, the uncreated life, at once and
as a matter of course. But that is guesswork. You and I are concerned
with the way things work now.
<br><br>
And the present state of things is this. The two kinds of life are now
not only different (they would always have been that) but actually
opposed. The natural life in each of us is something self-centred,
something that wants to be petted and admired, to take advantage of
other lives, to exploit the whole universe. And especially it wants to
be left to itself: to keep well away from anything better or stronger or
higher than it, anything that might make it feel small. It is afraid of
the light and air of the spiritual world, just as people who have been
brought up to be dirty are afraid of a bath. And in a sense it is quite
right. It knows that if the spiritual life gets hold of it, all its
self-centredness and self-will are going to be killed and it is ready to
fight tooth and nail to avoid that.
<br><br>
Did you ever think, when you were a child, what fun it would be if your
toys could come to life? Well suppose you could really have brought them
to life. Imagine turning a tin soldier into a real little man. It would
involve turning the tin into flesh. And suppose the tin soldier did not
like it. He is not interested in flesh; all he sees is that the tin is
being spoilt. He thinks you are killing him. He will do everything he
can to prevent you. He will not be made into a man if he can help it.
<br><br>
What you would have done about that tin soldier I do not know. But what
God did about us was this. The Second Person in God, the Son, became
human Himself: was born into the world as an actual man—a real man of a
particular height, with hair of a particular colour, speaking a
particular language, weighing so many stone. The Eternal Being, who
knows everything and who created the whole universe, became not only a
man but (before that) a baby, and before that a <i>fœtus</i> inside a Woman’s
body. If you want to get the hang of it, think how you would like to
become a slug or a crab.
<br><br>
The result of this was that you now had one man who really was what all
men were intended to be: one man in whom the created life, derived from
His Mother, allowed itself to be completely and perfectly turned into
the begotten life. The natural human creature in Him was taken up fully
into the divine Son. Thus in one instance humanity had, so to speak,
arrived: had passed into the life of Christ. And because the whole
difficulty for us is that the natural life has to be, in a sense,
“killed,” He chose an earthly career which involved the killing of His
human desires at every turn—poverty, misunderstanding from His own
family, betrayal by one of His intimate friends, being jeered at and
manhandled by the Police, and execution by torture. And then, after
being thus killed—killed every day in a sense—the human creature in Him,
because it was united to the divine Son, came to life again. The Man in
Christ rose again: not only the God. That is the whole point. For the
first time we saw a real man. One tin soldier—real tin, just like the
rest—had come fully and splendidly alive.
<br><br>
And here, of course, we come to the point where my illustration about
the tin soldier breaks down. In the case of real toy soldiers or
statues, if one came to life, it would obviously make no difference to
the rest. They are all separate. But human beings are not. They look
separate because you see them walking about separately. But then, we are
so made that we can see only the present moment. If we could see the
past, then of course it would look different. For there was a time when
every man was part of his mother, and (earlier still) part of his father
as well: and when they were part of his grandparents. If you could see
humanity spread out in time, as God sees it, it would not look like a
lot of separate things dotted about. It would look like one single
growing thing—rather like a very complicated tree. Every individual
would appear connected with every other. And not only that. Individuals
are not really separate from God any more than from one another. Every
man, woman, and child all over the world is feeling and breathing at
this moment only because God, so to speak, is “keeping him going.”
<br><br>
Consequently, when Christ becomes man it is not really as if you could
become one particular tin soldier. It is as if something which is always
affecting the whole human mass begins, at one point, to affect that
whole human mass in a new way. From that point the effect spreads
through all mankind. It makes a difference to people who lived before
Christ as well as to people who lived after Him. It makes a difference
to people who have never heard of Him. It is like dropping into a glass
of water one drop of something which gives a new taste or a new colour
to the whole lot. But, of course, none of these illustrations really
works perfectly. In the long run God is no one but Himself and what He
does is like nothing else. You could hardly expect it to be.
<br><br>
What, then, is the difference which He has made to the whole human mass?
It is just this; that the business of becoming a son of God, of being
turned from a created thing into a begotten thing, of passing over from
the temporary biological life into timeless “spiritual” life, has been
done for us. Humanity is already “saved” in principle. We individuals
have to appropriate that salvation. But the really tough work—the bit we
could not have done for ourselves—has been done for us. We have not got
to try to climb up into spiritual life by our own efforts; it has
already come down into the human race. If we will only lay ourselves
open to the one Man in whom it was fully present, and who, in spite of
being God, is also a real man, He will do it in us and for us. Remember
what I said about “good infection.” One of our own race has this new
life: if we get close to Him we shall catch it from Him.
<br><br>
Of course, you can express this in all sorts of different ways. You can
say that Christ died for our sins. You may say that the Father has
forgiven us because Christ has done for us what we ought to have done.
You may say that we are washed in the blood of the Lamb. You may say
that Christ has defeated death. They are all true. If any of them do not
appeal to you, leave it alone and get on with the formula that does.
And, whatever you do, do not start quarrelling with other people because
they use a different formula from yours.

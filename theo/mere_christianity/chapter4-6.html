                               <p>TWO NOTES</p>
<br><br>

In order to avoid misunderstanding I here add notes on two points
arising out of the last chapter.
<br><br>
(1) One sensible critic wrote asking me why, if God wanted sons instead
of “toy soldiers,” He did not <i>beget</i> many sons at the outset instead of
first <i>making</i> toy soldiers and then bringing them to life by such a
difficult and painful process. One part of the answer to this question
is fairly easy: the other part is probably beyond all human knowledge.
The easy part is this. The process of being turned from a creature into
a son would not have been difficult or painful if the human race had not
turned away from God centuries ago. They were able to do this because He
gave them free will: He gave them free will because a world of mere
automata could never love and therefore never know infinite happiness.
The difficult part is this. All Christians are agreed that there is, in
the full and original sense, only one “Son of God.” If we insist on
asking “But could there have been many?” we find ourselves in very deep
water. Have the words “Could have been” any sense at all when applied to
God? You can say that one particular finite thing “could have been”
different from what it is, because it would have been different if
something else had been different, and the something else would have
been different if some third thing had been different, and so on. (The
letters on this page would have been red if the printer had used red
ink, and he would have used red ink if he had been instructed to, and so
on.) But when you are talking about God—i.e. about the rock bottom,
irreducible Fact on which all other facts depend—it is nonsensical to
ask if It could have been otherwise. It is what It is, and there is an
end of the matter. But quite apart from this, I find a difficulty about
the very idea of the Father begetting many sons from all eternity. In
order to be many they would have to be somehow different from one
another. Two pennies have the same shape. How are they two? By occupying
different places and containing different atoms. In other words, to
think of them as different, we have had to bring in space and matter; in
fact we have had to bring in “Nature” or the created universe. I can
understand the distinction between the Father and the Son without
bringing in space or matter, because the one begets and the other is
begotten. The Father’s relation to the Son is not the same as the Son’s
relation to the Father. But if there were several sons they would all be
related to one another and to the Father in the same way. How would they
differ from one another? One does not notice the difficulty at first, of
course. One thinks one can form the idea of several “sons.” But when I
think closely, I find that the idea seemed possible only because I was
vaguely imagining them as human forms standing about together in some
kind of space. In other words, though I pretended to be thinking about
something that exists before any universe was made, I was really
smuggling in the picture of a universe and putting that something
<i>inside</i> it. When I stop doing that and still try to think of the Father
begetting many sons “before all worlds” I find I am not really thinking
of anything. The idea fades away into mere words. (Was Nature—space and
time and matter—created precisely in order to make many-ness possible?
Is there perhaps no other way of getting many eternal spirits except by
first making many natural creatures, in a universe, and then
spiritualising them? But of course all this is guesswork.)
<br><br>
(2) The idea that the whole human race is, in a sense, one thing—one
huge organism, like a tree—must not be confused with the idea that
individual differences do not matter or that real people, Tom and Nobby
and Kate, are somehow less important than collective things like
classes, races, and so forth. Indeed the two ideas are opposites. Things
which are parts of a single organism may be very different from one
another: things which are not, may be very alike. Six pennies are quite
separate and very alike: my nose and my lungs are very different but
they are only alive at all because they are parts of my body and share
its common life. Christianity thinks of human individuals not as mere
members of a group or items in a list, but as organs in a body—different
from one another and each contributing what no other could. When you
find yourself wanting to turn your children, or pupils, or even your
neighbours, into people exactly like yourself, remember that God
probably never meant them to be that. You and they are different organs,
intended to do different things. On the other hand, when you are tempted
not to bother about someone else’s troubles because they are “no
business of yours,” remember that though he is different from you he is
part of the same organism as you. If you forget that he belongs to the
same organism as yourself you will become an Individualist. If you
forget that he is a different organ from you, if you want to suppress
differences and make people all alike, you will become a Totalitarian.
But a Christian must not be either a Totalitarian or an Individualist.
<br><br>
I feel a strong desire to tell you—and I expect you feel a strong desire
to tell me—which of these two errors is the worse. That is the devil
getting at us. He always sends errors into the world in pairs—pairs of
opposites. And he always encourages us to spend a lot of time thinking
which is the worse. You see why, of course? He relies on your extra
dislike of the one error to draw you gradually into the opposite one.
But do not let us be fooled. We have to keep our eyes on the goal and go
straight through between both errors. We have no other concern than that
with either of them.

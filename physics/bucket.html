	<h3>Bucket problem</h3>
	Jacob is camping in the mountains with his friends and, like a responsible citizen, fills up a bucket with water before he starts the fire for that night.  When he goes to the water spout to fill up his big orange Home Depot bucket (which has a glossy reflective interior), he notices that his headlamp makes a very strange reflection at the bottom of his bucket!  Perplexed, he decides to forget about it, saying "oh well I probably need to know like abstract linear calculus to figure out why this happens."  Which was wrong of him.

	<h3>Theoretical set-up</h3>
	1/17/19 - As with any problem, we need to make some simplifying assumptions!  Suppose the light source is a height $h$ above the base of the bucket (radius $R$) and the bucket's walls extend arbitrarily high.  Furthermore, the light source is assumed to be very small, scattering light evenly in all directions.  Looking directly down into the bucket, the light source is offset from the center-axis by a distance $d.$

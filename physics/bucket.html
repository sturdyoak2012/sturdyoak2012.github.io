	<h3>Bucket problem</h3>
	1/17/19 - Jacob is camping in the mountains with his friends and, like a responsible citizen, fills up a bucket with water before he starts the fire for that night.  When he goes to the water spout to fill up his big orange Home Depot bucket, he notices that his headlamp makes a very strange reflection at the bottom of his bucket!  Perplexed, he decides to forget about it, saying "oh well I probably need to know like abstract linear calculus to figure out why this happens."  Which was wrong of him.

The objective will be to record the spectral lines using light sensitive photo paper using as little money as possible, mostly since I have access to a darkroom at school.  We will see how it goes!
<br><br>
<h3>Plan</h3>
I purchased a "EISCO quantitative spectrometer" from Amazon, and it appears to be nothing more than a diffraction grating and a 400-700 nm wavelength scale inside a box.  I also purchased a little diaphragm for eight dollars, and it has slits of widths 0.075, 0.15, and 0.4 mm, along with a nice double slit that I might use some other time as well.  The purpose is to decrease the width of the spectral lines.  
<br><br>
I anticipate the major challenge being the calibration of the spectral lines.  Each photo paper strip will need to be placed in the same exact place for every setup, so that way I can line them all up and match some known spectral lines with their respective wavelengths.  If it's linear, I think it won't be too difficult.  
<br><br>
The sensitivity of light sensitive photo paper can vary by wavelength.  For instance, sodium lamps can be used in darkrooms because some papers aren't sensitive to the monochromatic yellow sodium light.  I will see how big of an impact this has?
<h3>Update 1:</h3>
The spectrometer I got will not suffice!  It works really well in combination with the slit, but I won't be able to record the spectral lines, I can only look at them.  I misjudged its design and turns out I will definitely need at least two lenses to properly do this.  Here's a little illustration I made:

The necessary offset of the second lens can be calculated using the equation $\lambda = d\sin\theta$, due to the path difference necessary for constructive interference.

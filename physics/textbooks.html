<h1>My Textbook Recommendations</h1>

My recommendations are in bold.

<h3>Introductory (Calculus based)</h3>

<b><i>Physics</i> by Halliday, Resnick, and Krane</b>
<br>
The most frequently recommended for high school olympiad preparation, and definitely the best!

<br><br>

<i>University Physics</i> by Young and Freedman
<br>
Not as difficult as HRK.  But this was actually my first textbook, and it is still quite good.  Served me well at least.

<br>
<br>

<h3>Freshman Mechanics</h3>

<b><i>An Introduction to Mechanics</i> by Kleppner and Kolenkow</b>
<br>
To be honest, I haven't actually read this book.  However, my homework problems for my freshman physics class come from this book, and the problems are all very instructive and at a very good level.  It's the standard, and deservedly so.

<br>
<br>

<i>Introduction to Classical Mechanics</i> by Morin
<br>
Apparently, this is the book used at Harvard.  The problems are really really challenging, but the novelty of the problems also detracts from the value of this book as a textbook.  A lot of problems are very "tricky", so they're not very instructive.  However, they can be really good for developing problem solving skills, I guess.  The text itself is too advanced and not comprehensive enough for a freshman treatment, and too easy for a junior treament of classical mechanics.  However, the relativity chapters were quite good.  (Also, I got this book for free which was great.)

<h3>Freshman E&M</h3>

<i>Introduction to Electricity and Magnetism</i> by Purcell and Morin
<br>
This book is really well known for its introduction to magnetism as a relativistic consequence of electricity.  A lot of people like this book, but I didn't.  I also didn't spend much time on this.  (Also got it for free.)  The trouble with this book is that it overlaps almost 75% with Griffith's book, but the 25% is important enough that you have to read Griffith's book again.  That is why I would recommend getting a more solid foundation in the basics with something like HRK and then just skipping this book.  I'm probably in the minority here though.

<br>
<br>

<h3>Mathematics</h3>

<b><i>Div, Grad, Curl, and all that</i> by Schey</b>
<br>
Really fantastic introductory book for vector calculus.  A short 1-month read at the most, and the problems are good.  Not too rigorous - perfect for a physics student.  However, it should be noted that this is still just an introductory book, and following this up with Griffith's vector calculus review in his E&M book would be perfect.

<br>
<br>

<b><i>Introduction to Linear Algebra</i> by Strang</b>
<br>
Written horribly in terms of style and presentation, but it's still good, and it's what I used.  These read more like lecture notes than a textbook, but the problems are good.  Actually, just trying to figure out the organizational structure of each section is a great exercise in itself.
<br>
<br>

<i>Differential Equations and Boundary Problems</i> by Edwards and Penney
<br>
Not really a big fan, but I probably just hate differential equations.  It works.

<br>
<br>

<b><i>Linear Algebra Done Right</i> by Axler</b>
<br>
A great second linear algebra book.  I read this after studying quantum mechanics to fill in some gaps, and I really enjoyed the clarity of the presentation.  It is very concise, but organized very masterfully.  The problems are very instructive too.  (But do not try using this as a first linear algebra book... that would be a waste of time.  Too abstract as a meaningful first pass.)

<br>
<br>

<i>Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering</i> by Riley, Hobson, and Bence
<br>
This book is not suitable for self studying.  The presentation is so disjointed (which is necessary to keep the page count below 1500 probably) that I can't see anybody understanding the material as a first pass.  Probably wouldn't be so bad with a teacher, but not everybody has that.  

<br>
<br>

<h3>Junior Quantum Mechanics</h3>

<b><i>Principles of Quantum Mechanics</i> by Shankar</b>
<br>
Really math intensive.  This was my first quantum book, and it took me about 6-7 months of pretty much daily working to go cover to cover.  First 15 chapters - really thorough and sets a great foundation.  Exercises are sparse, so I did pretty much each one.  Certain sections after the first 15 are a bit not as comprehensive, and I had to use other books to make sense of things.  I really enjoyed working through this book - I actually really looked forward to studying, somehow.  (P.S. the typesetting is beautiful.)
<br>
<br>

<i>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</i> by Griffiths
<br>
I haven't really read this book.  It was helpful when Shankar was unclear, though.  From what I gathered, this book is a lot more structured and organized.  In this book, you know what's really important because Griffiths puts it in a gray box.  (Whereas Shankar does not even label important results.)  However, Griffiths is a lot less mathematically rigorous.  A lot of results are just stated.  In many ways this is a good thing - you can get a survey of the landscape before learning the derivations.  There are also a lot more problems, though I heard many are somewhat mindless?  There is one place that this book really suffers compared to Shankar, and that is the late introduction of the mathematical formalism.  Shankar lays out <i>all</i> the math in the first chapter, whereas Griffiths gets through two chapters before touching the linear algebra.  I think this might make a big difference: in Shankar, the linear algebraic formalism is hammered into the brain since day 1.  Griffiths gets a headstart on the physics, but stops three chapters in when he realizes he forgot to put his shoes on!  

<br>
<br>

<h3>Junior Statistical Mechanics</h3>

<b><i>Thermal Physics</i> by Schroeder</b>
<br>
Not a difficult book by any means, but it was really really clear when I used it.  The problems (though I did not try them) also looked really great.

<br>
<br>

<i>Thermal Physics</i> by Kittel
<br>
The precursor to his book with Kroemer, this was my first book.  I don't think anybody even uses this anymore, so whatever.  It's not so bad, but a lot of sections lacked clarity.  I finally parted ways with Kittel about 2/3-rds of the way in.

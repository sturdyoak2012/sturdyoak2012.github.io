<h1>Royce Lakes</h1>
<br><br>
Route: <a href="https://caltopo.com/m/A2Q7">Caltopo map</a>
<br><br>
A 5 day trip (including 2 days of driving) with my friends Daniel Yao, Hagen 
Zhang, Jeremy Xu, and Joshua Mei.  

<br><br>
<h4>Day 0</h4>
We drove 5 hours from the Bay Area to our campsite at Sonora Pass.  We wanted 
to camp along the way to reduce the driving time and help acclimate.
<br><br>
Along the way, we stopped in Oakdale to buy dinner and breakfast.  We had 
Subway and KFC - stopping at this little strip mall has been somewhat of a 
tradition since we stop there so often on the way to the Yosemite area.
<br><br>
At the campsite at Sonora Pass, there were a lot of cars but not very many 
people - most people were out on the trails.  We set up next to a bench, 
ate our dinners, and got to sleep quickly.
<br><br>

<h4>Day 1</h4>
<a href="3.jpg" data-lightbox="group"><img src="3.jpg"></a>
<p>Sunrise</p> 
<br><br>
After we cleaned up, we had to finish all our food or throw the rest away - 
we couldn't keep food in the car at the trailhead.  Jeremy bought way too 
much food in Oakdale, so we gave all of our leftovers to a kind stranger 
that was camping nearby.  
<br><br>
After stopping for gas in Bridgeport, we drove to the Pine Creek Pass 
trailhead.
<br><br>
<a href="4.jpg" data-lightbox="group"><img src="4.jpg"></a>
<br><br>
Our pace in the initial uphill was very quick, pretty fast beyond my 
expectations.  Several streams cut across the trail, so there was no 
shortage of water.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Strangely, our pace slowed significantly as the trail flattened after the 
first few miles.  
<br><br>
<a href="7.jpg" data-lightbox="group"><img src="7.jpg"></a>
<br><br>
The clouds began to build up heavily as we reached Pine Lake.  Although a 
few drops fell on us here and there, it never really rained.  
<a href="8.jpg" data-lightbox="group"><img src="8.jpg"></a>

<br><br>
We did not see very much of Upper Pine Lake, even though the trail winded 
very close to it.  The area was very buggy, so we were keen to get out of 
there quickly.
<br><br>
We chose to stay the night at Honeymoon Lake.  There were excellent campsites 
on the southeast side, windy and exposed enough to keep the mosquitoes away. 
Most of us took a nap after setting up our tents.
<br><br>
For dinner, some of us had Mountain House and I had ramen with spam.  We 
talked for a long time through the evening, and we tried to catch a glimpse 
of the comet that was in the news.  Even though I brought my binoculars, we 
couldn't see it.  To be fair, we didn't really know where to look.  I was 
in the process of switching from contacts to glasses, so I couldn't see a 
single thing in the sky anyways.  I had some pretty killer sleep that night 
though.

<br><br>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
The goal for the second day was to make it all the way to the largest lake 
of the four Royce Lakes.  It was not very much distance or elevation gain, 
but I knew the terrain would get trickier towards the end.
<br><br>
It was a comfortable uphill hike through meadows to Pine Creek Pass from Honeymoon Lake.  It was beautiful in the morning light.
<br><br>

<br><br>
At the top of Pine Creek Pass, we were treated to nice views of the opposing 
mountains.  We could even see Mt. Humphreys, though I did not recognize it at 
the moment since I was more familiar with the more iconic angle.

<br><br>
After a short stop, we cut directly west towards the Royce Lakes.  It was 
very easy off-trail walking, over grass and granite slabs.  The gradient 
was not very steep either, but we took our time since it was very beautiful.
<br><br>

<br><br>
We spent an awkwardly long time trying to take a group picture of ourselves 
since there was nobody around to take it for us.  
<br><br>

<br><br>
We filtered water at the first (southernmost) Royce Lake.  Merriam Peak 
towered above us, and it would continue to be a focal point for the rest 
of the day.

<br><br>
After a short lunch on the first Royce Lake, the wind began to pick up 
strongly.  The clouds were rolling in with it, and we knew we had a limited 
time before the weather came too.  We headed further up.
<br><br>
It was a bit tricky to navigate the east side of the second lake due to 
an annoying patch of snow.  We made it across in one piece despite dislodging 
some nerve-rattling boulders from underneath our feet.
<br><br>
<a href="26.jpg" data-lightbox="group"><img src="26.jpg"></a>
<p>The incredible clarity of the lake</p> 
<br><br>
We had a beautiful break at the north end of the second Royce Lake.  We had 
fun trying to take time-lapses of the clouds.

<br><br>
Our planned campsite was at the saddle west of Treasure, but navigating the 
east side of the third Royce Lake was very tricky due to all the boulders. 
At least we were lucky that the snowfield had melted sufficiently.  We 
managed to scramble just quickly enough to make it to the northeast end 
of the lake right when it began to rain.
<br><br>
<a href="28.jpg" data-lightbox="group"><img src="28.jpg"></a>
<p>At the southeast end of the third Royce Lake</p> 
<br><br>
It was very rocky despite being mostly flat, but we managed to find a sandy 
flat area to set up our tents.  We did that quickly and dove in quickly to 
wait out the short drizzle that was starting.  
<br><br>
After the rain stopped, Hagen and I took a short profanity-laced dip into the 
freezing water while the rest of them napped.  Surprisingly, it felt really 
good afterwards.
<br><br>
When we were making dinner together, I discovered that my fuel bottle pump 
had snapped inside my pack.  Luckily, Hagen had his Jetboil which was 
sufficient for the five of us. 
<br><br>
We watched the sunset together and then played One Night (very hard game).

<br><br>
<h4>Day 3</h4>
Hagen, Josh, and I got up at 4:50 to watch the sunrise, which didn't 
disappoint.  Most unfortunately, I accidentally stepped into the lake 
because it was dark and it did not look like a lake at all.  My left foot 
was frozen for quite a while.  But the sunrise made up for it.

<br><br>
After hearing its distinctive calls the previous evening and in the morning 
as well, we finally located the marmot that had been following us.
<br><br>
<a href="34.jpg" data-lightbox="group"><img src="34.jpg"></a>
<br><br>
After a loud discussion about how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox">Coastline paradox</a> affected the proper measurement of 
trails, we headed back to the trailhead, returning via the more standard 
route (via Royce Pass and Granite Park).  We all wanted McDonald's pretty badly, so it was very speedy.
<br><br>
We ate McDonald's in Bishop while calling motels to check room rates for the 
night.  After an embarrassing phone call by me, we decided to just book 
online.  We landed a nice room in a motel in Lee Vining, where we had a very 
pleasant evening with ice cream, steak, fish, fries, sundaes, and crappy 
American vegetables.
